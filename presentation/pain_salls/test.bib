The study investigated the relationship between neighborhood design and individual levels of social capital. Data were obtained from a household survey that measured the social capital of citizens living in neighborhoods that ranged from traditional, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented designs to modern, car-dependent suburban subdivisions in Galway, Ireland. Results. The analyses indicate that persons living in walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods have higher levels of social capital compared with those living in car-oriented suburbs. Respondents living in walkable neighborhoods were more likely to know their neighbors, participate politically, trust others, and be socially engaged. Conclusions. Walkable, mixed-use neighborhood designs can encourage the development of social capital.},

	abstract = {Why are some communities more cohesive than others? The answer to the puzzle has two parts: (a) due to variations in the attributes of residents, and/or (b) due to variations in the attributes of places. However, few studies have sought to examine the community-level determinants of social capital. In the present study, we examined the associations between social capital and different area characteristics: (1) neighborhood walkability, (2) date of community settlement, and (3) degree of urbanization. We based our analysis on 9414 respondents from the Aichi Gerontological Evaluation Study (AGES), conducted in 2003. No significant positive association was found between the walkability score and any of the social capital indices. In contrast, community age and degree of urbanization were associated with many of the social capital indicators, even after controlling for characteristics of the residents. Community social capital thus appears to be more consistently linked to the broader historical and geographic contexts of neighborhoods, rather than to the proximal built environment (as measured by walkability).},

	abstract = {The continuing obesity epidemic in the USA calls for the examination of antecedents to the well-known risk factors of physical activity and diet. The neighborhood built environment has been extensively studied in relation to obesity noting an increased risk of development and prevalence of obesity in relation to numerous built environment characteristics (lack of green spaces, higher number of fast food restaurants, low walkability indices). The neighborhood social environment, however, has been less extensively studied but is perhaps an equally important component of the neighborhood environment. The neighborhood social environment, particularly constructs of social capital, collective efficacy, and crime, is associated with obesity among both adults and children. Several studies have identified physical activity as a potential pathway of the neighborhood social environment and obesity association. Further work on social networks and norms and residential segregation, as well as the examination of dietary behaviors and mental health as potential mediating pathways, is necessary. Given the existing evidence, intervening on the neighborhood social environment may prove to be an effective target for the prevention on obesity. Intervention studies that promote healthy behaviors and prevent obesity while addressing aspects of the neighborhood social environment are necessary to better identify targets for obesity prevention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Social capital consists of features of social organization--such as trust between citizens, norms of reciprocity, and group membership--that facilitate collective action. This article reports a contextual analysis of social capital and individual self-rated health, with adjustment for individual household income, health behaviors, and other covariates. METHODS: Self-rated health ("Is your overall health excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?") was assessed among 167,259 individuals residing in 39 US states, sampled by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Social capital indicators, aggregated to the state level, were obtained from the General Social Surveys. RESULTS: Individual-level factors (e.g., low income, low education, smoking) were strongly associated with self-rated poor health. However, even after adjustment for these proximal variables, a contextual effect of low social capital on risk of self-rated poor health was found. For example, the odds ratio for fair or poor health associated with living in areas with the lowest levels of social trust was 1.41 (95\% confidence interval = 1.33, 1.50) compared with living in high-trust states. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous findings on the health advantages stemming from social capital.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding which physical environmental factors affect adult obesity, and how best to influence them, is important for public health and urban planning. Previous attempts to summarise the literature have not systematically assessed the methodological quality of included studies, or accounted for environmental differences between continents or the ways in which environmental characteristics were measured.
Methods: We have conducted an updated review of the scientific literature on associations of physical environmental factors with adult weight status, stratified by continent and mode of measurement, accompanied by a detailed risk-of-bias assessment. Five databases were systematically searched for studies published between 1995 and 2013.
Results: Two factors, urban sprawl and land use mix, were found consistently associated with weight status, although only in North America.
Conclusions: With the exception of urban sprawl and land use mix in the US the results of the current review confirm that the available research does not allow robust identification of ways in which that physical environment influences adult weight status, even after taking into account methodological quality.},

The prevalence of overweight also increased during this period from 55.9\% to 64.5\% (P\&lt;.001). Extreme obesity (BMI ≥40) also increased significantly in the population, from 2.9\% to 4.7\% (P = .002). Although not all changes were statistically significant, increases occurred for both men and women in all age groups and for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Racial/ethnic groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of obesity or overweight for men. Among women, obesity and overweight prevalences were highest among non-Hispanic black women. More than half of non-Hispanic black women aged 40 years or older were obese and more than 80\% were overweight.ConclusionsThe increases in the prevalences of obesity and overweight previously observed continued in 1999-2000.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3·4 million deaths, 3·9\% of years of life lost, and 3·8\% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013.
METHODS: We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19,244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
FINDINGS: Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28·8\% (95\% UI 28·4-29·3) to 36·9\% (36·3-37·4) in men, and from 29·8\% (29·3-30·2) to 38·0\% (37·5-38·5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23·8\% (22·9-24·7) of boys and 22·6\% (21·7-23·6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8·1\% (7·7-8·6) to 12·9\% (12·3-13·5) in 2013 for boys and from 8·4\% (8·1-8·8) to 13·4\% (13·0-13·9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50\% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down.
INTERPRETATION: Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

	abstract = {Objective: While behavioral change is necessary to reverse the obesity epidemic, it can be difficult to achieve and sustain in unsupportive residential environments. This study hypothesized that environmental resources supporting walking and a healthy diet are associated with reduced obesity incidence. Design and Methods: Data came from 4,008 adults aged 45-84 at baseline who participated in a neighborhood ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Participants were enrolled at six study sites at baseline (2000-2002) and neighborhood scales were derived from a supplementary survey that asked community residents to rate availability of healthy foods and walking environments for a 1-mile buffer area. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Associations between incident obesity and neighborhood exposure were examined using proportional hazards and generalized linear regression. Results: Among 4,008 nonobese participants, 406 new obesity cases occurred during 5 years of follow-up. Neighborhood healthy food environment was associated with 10\% lower obesity incidence per s.d. increase in neighborhood score. The association persisted after adjustment for baseline BMI and individual-level covariates (hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.79, 0.97), and for correlated features of the walking environment but CIs widened to include the null (HR 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.77, 1.03). Associations between neighborhood walking environment and lower obesity were weaker and did not persist after adjustment for correlated neighborhood healthy eating amenities (HR 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.84, 1.15). Conclusions: Altering the residential environment so that healthier behaviors and lifestyles can be easily chosen may be a precondition for sustaining existing healthy behaviors and for adopting new healthy behaviors.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To examine whether neighborhood deprivation increases the odds of hospital registration for childhood and adolescent epilepsy, after accounting for family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics.
Methods
An open cohort of all children aged 2–17 years was followed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. Children's residential addresses were geocoded and classified according to neighborhood deprivation. Data were analyzed by multilevel logistic regression, with family- and individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level.
Results
During the study period, among a total of 1,020,766 children, 9309 (0.9\%) were registered with childhood and adolescent epilepsy. Age-adjusted cumulative hospital rates of childhood and adolescent epilepsy increased with increasing neighborhood-level deprivation across all family- and individual-level sociodemographic categories. The odds ratio (OR) for hospital registration for childhood and adolescent epilepsy for those living in high-deprivation neighborhoods versus those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods was 1.15. High level deprivation remained significantly associated with higher odds of childhood and adolescent epilepsy after adjustment for family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics (OR=1.12, 95\% CI=1.04–1.21, p=0.003).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that neighborhood characteristics modestly affect the odds of hospital registration for childhood and adolescent epilepsy independently of family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics.},

To examine whether there is an association between neighborhood deprivation and childhood autism, after accounting for family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics.
Methods
An open cohort of all children aged 2–11 years was followed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. Childhood residential locations were geocoded and classified according to neighborhood deprivation (an index of low education, low income, unemployment, and receipt of welfare assistance). Data were analyzed by multilevel logistic regression, with family- and individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level.
Results
During the study period, among a total of 643,456 children, 1699 (0.3\%) were diagnosed with childhood autism. Age-standardized cumulative incidence, defined as first registration for childhood autism during the study period, increased with increasing level of neighborhood deprivation. In the study population, 2.2 per 1000 and 3.6 per 1000 children in the least and most deprived neighborhoods, respectively, were diagnosed with childhood autism. Incidence of childhood autism increased with increasing neighborhood-level deprivation across all family and individual-level sociodemographic categories. The odds ratio (OR) for childhood autism for those living in high-deprivation neighborhoods versus those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods was 1.59 (95\% confidence interval = 1.35–1.88). High neighborhood deprivation remained significantly associated with odds of childhood autism after adjustment for family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics (OR = 1.28, 95\% confidence interval = 1.07–1.53, P = 0.007).
Conclusions
This study is the largest so far on potential neighborhood influences on childhood autism. Our results show that neighborhood deprivation is associated with childhood autism, independently of family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Little is known about the association between neighborhood linking social capital and psychiatric medication in the elderly. The present study analyzes whether there is an association between linking social capital (a theoretical concept describing the amount of trust between individuals and societal institutions) and prescription of antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, antidepressants, or anti-dementia drugs.
Design, setting, participants and measurements
The entire Swedish population aged 65+, a total of 1,292,816 individuals, were followed from 1 July 2005 until first prescription of psychiatric medication, death, emigration, or the end of the study on 31 December 2010. Small geographic units were used to define neighborhoods. The definition of linking social capital was based on mean voting participation in each neighborhood unit, categorized in three groups. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and between-neighborhood variance in three different models.
Results
There was an inverse association between the level of linking social capital and prescription of psychiatric medications (except for anti-dementia drugs). The associations decreased, but remained significant, after accounting for age, sex, family income, marital status, country of birth, and education level (except for antidepressants). The OR for prescription of antipsychotics in the crude model was 1.65 (95\% CI 1.53–1.78) and decreased, but remained significant (OR = 1.26; 95\% CI 1.17–1.35), after adjustment for the individual-level sociodemographic variables.
Conclusions
Decision-makers should take into account the potentially negative effect of linking social capital on psychiatric disorders when planning sites of primary care centers and psychiatric clinics, as well as other kinds of community support for elderly patients with such disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
Risk for drug abuse (DA) is strongly associated with neighborhood social deprivation (SD). However, the causal nature of this relationship is unclear.


Method
Three Swedish population-based cohorts were followed up over 5 years for incident registration of DA in medical, legal or pharmacy records. In each cohort, we examined the SD–DA association, controlling carefully for individual socio-economic status (SES) with multiple measures, in the entire sample and among pairs of first cousins, paternal and maternal half-siblings, full siblings and monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for SD exposure. The number of informative relative pairs ranged from 6366 to 166 208.


Results
In all cohorts, SD was prospectively related to risk for incident DA. In relative pairs discordant for SD exposure, the SD–DA association was similar to that seen in the entire population in cousins, half-siblings, full siblings and MZ twins. Eliminating subjects who were residentially unstable or had DA in the first two follow-up years did not alter this pattern. When divided by age, in the youngest groups, the SD–DA association was weaker in siblings than in the entire population.


Conclusions
Across three cohorts, controlling for individual SES and confounding familial factors, SD prospectively predicted risk for incident DA registration. These results support the hypothesis that the SD–DA association is in part causal and unlikely to result entirely from personal attributes, which both increase risk for DA and cause selection into high SD environments. At least part of the SD–DA association arises because exposure to SD causes an increased risk of DA.},

	abstract = {Background
Neighborhood deprivation has been implicated in lung cancer but no study has simultaneously analyzed the potential effect of neighborhood deprivation on both lung cancer incidence and mortality, after adjusting for individual-level socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities. The aim of this study was to analyze whether there is an association between neighborhood deprivation and incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer, beyond individual-level characteristics.
Design
The incident and mortality cases of lung cancer were determined in the entire Swedish population aged over 50 (3.2 million individuals) between 2000 and 2010. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual-level characteristics (age, marital status, family income, education, immigration status, urban/rural status, mobility, and comorbidities) at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. A neighborhood deprivation index, constructed from the variables education, income, unemployment, and welfare assistance, was used to assess the level of neighborhood deprivation.
Results
There was a strong association between level of neighborhood deprivation and incidence and mortality of lung cancer. In the fully adjusted model, the odds of lung cancer were 1.27 and 1.32, respectively, in the most deprived neighborhood. The between-neighborhood variance (i.e., the random intercept) was over 1.96 times the standard error in all models, indicating that there were significant differences in incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer between neighborhoods.
Conclusions
Results suggest that neighborhood deprivation is associated with incident and mortality cases of lung cancer in Sweden, independently of individual-level characteristics.},

	abstract = {Background
We aimed to study differences in the prescribing of warfarin, aspirin and statins to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in socio-economically diverse neighborhoods. We also aimed to explore the effects of neighborhood deprivation on the relationship between CHADS2 risk score and warfarin prescription.
Methods
Data were obtained from primary health care records that contained individual clinical data that were linked to national data on neighborhood of residence and a deprivation index for different neighborhoods. Logistic regression was used to estimate the potential neighborhood differences in prescribed warfarin, aspirin and statins, and the association between the CHADS2 score and prescribed warfarin treatment, in neighborhoods with high, middle (referent) and low socio-economic (SES).
Results
After adjustment for age, socio-economic factors, co-morbidities and moves to neighborhoods with different SES during follow-up, adults with AF living in high SES neighborhoods were more often prescribed warfarin (men odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.44 (1.27–1.62); and women OR (95\% CI): 1.19 (1.05–1.36)) and statins (men OR (95\% CI): 1.23 (1.07–1.41); women OR (95\% CI): 1.23 (1.05–1.44)) compared to their counterparts residing in middle SES. Prescription of aspirin was lower in men from high SES neighborhoods (OR (95\% CI): 0.75 (0.65–0.86)) than in those from middle SES neighborhoods. Higher CHADS2 risk scores were associated with higher warfarin prescription which remained after adjustment for neighborhood SES.
Conclusions
The apparent inequalities in pharmacotherapy seen in the present study call for resource allocation to primary care in neighborhoods with low and middle socio-economic status.},

More knowledge is needed on potential associations between individual-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors and psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.
Aims
To examine associations between, individual-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors and incident internalizing (anxiety and mood) disorders and externalizing (ADHD and conduct) disorders in children and adolescents, and to estimate the relative contributions of family and neighborhood to individual variation in these disorders.
Method
We performed a three-level logistic regression on all 542,195 children born in Sweden in 1992–1996, nested in 427,954 families, which in turn were nested in 8475 neighborhoods. The children were followed from 2000 to 2010 for incident internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders, assessed from medical records.
Results
26,514 children (4.8\%) were diagnosed with internalizing or externalizing psychiatric disorders. Approximately 29\% of the total individual variance in internalizing disorders could be attributed to the family level, which includes both genetic and family environmental effects, and 5\% to the neighborhood level. The corresponding figures for externalizing disorders were 43.5\% and 5.5\%, respectively. After adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic factors, high neighborhood deprivation was associated with increased risks of externalizing and internalizing psychiatric disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95\% credible interval [CI] = 1.25–1.50 and OR = 1.34, 95\% CI = 1.25–1.45, respectively), including conduct disorder (OR = 2.01, 95\% CI = 1.58–2.55), anxiety disorders (OR = 1.40, 95\% CI = 1.29–1.52), and mood disorders (OR = 1.21, 95\% CI, 1.09–1.35). The strongest association between neighborhood deprivation and ADHD was observed in moderately deprived neighborhoods (OR = 1.31, 95\% CI = 1.19–1.44).
Conclusions
These findings call for policies to promote mental health that consider potential influences from children's family and neighborhood environments.conclusion

	abstract = {Aims
This study examines the association between the incidence of drug abuse (DA) and linking (communal) social capital, a theoretical concept describing the amount of trust between individuals and societal institutions.
Methods
We present results from an 8-year population-based cohort study that followed all residents in Sweden, aged 15–44, from 2003 through 2010, for a total of 1,700,896 men and 1,642,798 women. Linking social capital was conceptualized as the proportion of people in a geographically defined neighborhood who voted in local government elections. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and between-neighborhood variance.
Results
We found robust associations between linking social capital and DA in men and women. For men, the OR for DA in the crude model was 2.11 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.02–2.21] for those living in neighborhoods with the lowest vs. highest level of social capital. After accounting for neighborhood level deprivation, the OR fell to 1.59 (1.51–1-68). The ORs remained significant after accounting for age, family income, marital status, country of birth, education level, and region of residence, and after further accounting for comorbidities and family history of comorbidities and family history of DA. For women, the OR decreased from 2.15 (2.03–2.27) in the crude model to 1.31 (1.22–1.40) in the final model, adjusted for multiple neighborhood-level, individual-level variables, and family history for DA.
Conclusions
Our study suggests that low linking social capital may have significant independent effects on DA.},

National registers were used to categorize neighborhood socioeconomic status into high, middle, and low and to retrieve information on incident ischemic strokes. Hazard ratios and their 95\% confidence intervals were estimated.ResultsA total of 1,153,451 adults (women 48.9\%) were followed for a mean of 5.5 years (SD 3.5 years), during which 1777 (0.30\%) strokes among men and 1374 (0.24\%) strokes among women were recorded. After adjustment for sex, marital status, education level, immigrant status, region of residence, and neighborhood services, there was a lower risk of stroke in residents from high-socioeconomic status neighborhoods (hazard ratio 0.87, 95\% confidence interval 0.78?0.96), and an increased risk of stroke in adults from low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods (hazard ratio 1.16, 95\% confidence interval 1.06?1.27), compared to their counterparts living in middle-socioeconomic status neighborhoods. After further adjustment for hospital diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation prior to the age of 40, the higher risk in neighborhoods with low socioeconomic status was attenuated, but remained significant (hazard ratio 1.12, 95\% confidence interval 1.02?1.23).ConclusionsIn a nationwide study of individuals between 40 and 50 years, we found that the risk of ischemic stroke differed depending on neighborhood socioeconomic status, which calls for increased efforts to prevent cardiovascular diseases in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods.},

Prior studies suggest that exposure to the natural environment may impact health. The present study examines the association between objective measures of block-level greenness (vegetative presence) and chronic medical conditions, including cardiometabolic conditions, in a large population-based sample of Medicare beneficiaries in Miami-Dade County, Florida.
Methods
The sample included 249,405 Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years whose location (ZIP+4) within Miami-Dade County, Florida, did not change, from 2010 to 2011. Data were obtained in 2013 and multilevel analyses conducted in 2014 to examine relationships between greenness, measured by mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from satellite imagery at the Census block level, and chronic health conditions in 2011, adjusting for neighborhood median household income, individual age, gender, race, and ethnicity.
Results
Higher greenness was significantly associated with better health, adjusting for covariates: An increase in mean block-level Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from 1 SD less to 1 SD more than the mean was associated with 49 fewer chronic conditions per 1,000 individuals, which is approximately similar to a reduction in age of the overall study population by 3 years. This same level of increase in mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes by 14\%, hypertension by 13\%, and hyperlipidemia by 10\%. Planned post-hoc analyses revealed stronger and more consistently positive relationships between greenness and health in lower- than higher-income neighborhoods.
Conclusions
Greenness or vegetative presence may be effective in promoting health in older populations, particularly in poor neighborhoods, possibly due to increased time outdoors, physical activity, or stress mitigation.},

	abstract = {Rationale \& Objective
Although socioeconomic status has been associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), little is known about its relationship to residential neighborhood context.
Study Design
Secondary analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the development and progression of subclinical cardiovascular disease.
Setting \& Participants
6,814 men and women who were between 45 and 84 years of age and free of cardiovascular disease were recruited between 2000 and 2002 from Baltimore, MD; Chicago, IL; Forsyth County, NC; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; and St. Paul, MN.
Exposures
A composite neighborhood problem score (calculated based on 7 participant-reported domains at study entry: adequacy of food sources, availability of parks/playground, noise, sidewalks, traffic, trash and litter, and violence) and a social cohesion score (calculated based on 5 participant-reported attributes of people in their neighborhood: close knit; get along; willing to help neighbors; trustworthy; and share values).
Outcomes
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; calculated using the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] creatinine–cystatin C equation) and an indicator of eGFR decline {\textgreater} 30\% since study entry using follow-up eGFR quantified at 4 examinations: 2000 to 2002, 2004 to 2005, 2005 to 2007, and 2010 to 2011.
Analytical Approach
Associations between each neighborhood measure (in separate models) and eGFR decline {\textgreater} 30\% from baseline and annualized eGFR change were estimated using Cox proportional hazards and linear mixed regression models, respectively, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
While neighborhood social context differs by race/ethnicity, neither neighborhood problems nor social cohesion was independently associated with eGFR decline after adjustment for confounders.
Limitations
Incomplete capture of the early stages of eGFR decline, reliance on observational data, limited variation in neighborhood measures, and the potential for residual confounding.
Conclusions
Although we showed no independent association between neighborhood context and eGFR decline, it is associated with many CKD risk factors and further work is needed to clarify whether it has an independent role in CKD.},

Research has not firmly established whether living in a deprived neighborhood predicts the incidence and case fatality of coronary heart disease (CHD), and whether effects vary across sociodemographic groups.
Methods
Prospective follow-up study of all Swedish women and men, aged 35 to 74 (1.9 million women, 1.8 million men). Women and men, without a history of CHD, were assessed on December 31, 1995, and followed from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2000, for first fatal or nonfatal CHD event (130,024 cases); data were analyzed in 2006. Neighborhood-level deprivation (index of education, income, unemployment, welfare assistance) was categorized as low, moderate, and high deprivation.
Results
Age-standardized CHD incidence was 1.9 times higher for women and 1.5 times higher for men in high- versus low-deprivation neighborhoods; 1-year case fatality from CHD was 1.6 times higher for women and 1.7 times higher for men in high versus low deprivation neighborhoods. The higher incidence in more deprived neighborhoods was observed across all individual-level sociodemographic groups (age, marital status, family income, education, immigration status, mobility, and urban/rural status). In multilevel logistic regression models, neighborhood deprivation remained significantly associated with both CHD incidence and case fatality for women and men after adjusting for the seven sociodemographic factors (p values {\textless}0.01). Effects were slightly stronger for women than men in an ancillary analysis that tested for gender differences.
Conclusions
The clustering of CHD and subsequent mortality among adults in deprived neighborhoods raises important clinical and public health concerns, and calls for a reframing of health problems to include neighborhood social environments, as they may affect health.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES--Measuring socio-economic deprivation is a major challenge usually addressed through the use of composite indices. This paper aims to clarify the technical details regarding composite index construction. The distribution of some variables, for example unemployment, varies over time, and these variations must be considered when composite indices are periodically re-evaluated. The process of normalisation is examined in detail and particular attention is paid to the importance of symmetry and skewness of the composite variable distributions. DESIGN--Four different solutions of the Townsend index of socioeconomic deprivation are compared to reveal the effects that differing transformation processes have on the meaning or interpretation of the final index values. Differences in the rank order and the relative separation between values are investigated. MAIN RESULTS--Constituent variables which have been transformed to yield a more symmetric distribution provide indices that behave similarly, irrespective of the actual transformation methods adopted. Normalisation is seen to be of less importance than the removal of variable skewness. Furthermore, the degree of success of the transformation in removing skewness has a major effect in determining the variation between the individual electoral ward scores. Constituent variables undergoing no transformation produce an index that is distorted by the inherent variable skewness, and this index is not consistent between re-evaluations, either temporally or spatially. CONCLUSIONS--Effective transformation of constituent variables should always be undertaken when generating a composite index. The most important aspect is the removal of variable skewness. There is no need for the transformed variables to be normally distributed, only symmetrically distributed, before standardisation. Even where additional parameter weights are to be applied, which significantly alter the final index, appropriate transformation procedures should be adopted for the purpose of consistency over time and between different geographical areas.},

RESULTS: The relatively weak associations between neighbourhood availability of potentially health-damaging and health-promoting goods, services and resources, and CHD incidence no longer remained significant after adjustment for neighbourhood-level deprivation and individual-level age and income.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of potentially health-damaging factors and lack of potentially health-promoting factors do not seem to contribute significantly to the development of CHD. Other features of deprived neighbourhoods appear to play a greater role.},

An emerging science using quantitative models has provided key insights into the dynamics of this epidemic, and made it possible to combine different pieces of evidence and calculate the impact of behaviors, interventions and policies at multiple levels – from person to population. Forecasts indicate large effects of high levels of obesity on future population health and economic outcomes. Energy gap models have quantified the relationships of changes in energy intake and expenditure to weight change, and documented the dominant role of increasing intake on obesity prevalence. The empirical evidence base for effective interventions is limited but growing. Several cost-effective policies are identified that governments should prioritize for implementation., Systems science provides a framework for organizing the complexity of forces driving the obesity epidemic and has important implications for policy-makers. Multiple players (including governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society) need to contribute complementary actions in a coordinated approach. Priority actions include policies to improve the food and built environments, cross-cutting actions (such as leadership, health-in-all policies, and monitoring), and much greater funding for prevention programs. Increased investment in population obesity monitoring would improve the accuracy of forecasts and evaluations. Embedding actions within existing systems in both health and non-health sectors (trade, agriculture, transport, urban planning, development) can greatly increase impact and sustainability. We call for a sustained worldwide effort to monitor, prevent and control obesity.},

It was hypothesized that, compared with persons of higher SES, persons of low SES would show greater weight gain or risk of weight gain over time. A search of electronic databases identified 34 relevant articles from developed countries reporting on studies that assessed the relationship of various measures of SES with weight change over time in adults (there were too few papers from developing countries (n=1) to include). Results of the methodologically strongest studies (those which obtained objectively measured adiposity data and used a follow-up period of 4 years or more) showed that, among non-black samples, there were relatively consistent inverse associations between occupation and weight gain for men and women. When SES was assessed using education, evidence was slightly less consistent, but still provided some support for the hypothesized relationship. However, when income was used as the indicator of SES, findings were inconsistent, although there were fewer studies available. There was little support for a relationship between SES and weight gain for black samples. In the context of the worldwide epidemic of obesity, these findings suggest that in developed countries, weight gain prevention efforts might best be focused on those who are most socioeconomically disadvantaged, particularly those in lower status occupations.},

	abstract = {Summary
The simultaneous increases in obesity in almost all countries seem to be driven mainly by changes in the global food system, which is producing more processed, affordable, and effectively marketed food than ever before. This passive overconsumption of energy leading to obesity is a predictable outcome of market economies predicated on consumption-based growth. The global food system drivers interact with local environmental factors to create a wide variation in obesity prevalence between populations. Within populations, the interactions between environmental and individual factors, including genetic makeup, explain variability in body size between individuals. However, even with this individual variation, the epidemic has predictable patterns in subpopulations. In low-income countries, obesity mostly affects middle-aged adults (especially women) from wealthy, urban environments; whereas in high-income countries it affects both sexes and all ages, but is disproportionately greater in disadvantaged groups. Unlike other major causes of preventable death and disability, such as tobacco use, injuries, and infectious diseases, there are no exemplar populations in which the obesity epidemic has been reversed by public health measures. This absence increases the urgency for evidence-creating policy action, with a priority on reduction of the supply-side drivers.},

	abstract = {It has commonly been suggested that in modern cities individual or household deprivation (for example, low income or education) is amplified by area level deprivation (for example, lack of jobs or good schools), in ways which damage the health of the poorest and increase health inequalities. The aim of this study was to determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005–2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and percentage of data zones containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A \& E hospitals, parks, waste disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities.},

	abstract = {More knowledge concerning the association between physical activity and objectively measured attributes of the built environment is needed. Previous studies on the association between objectively measured neighborhood walkability, physical activity, and walking have been conducted in the U.S. or Australia and research findings are available from only one country in Europe – Belgium. The first aim of this Swedish study of 2269 adults was to examine the associations between neighborhood walkability and walking for active transportation or leisure, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and whether these hypothesized associations are moderated by age, gender, income, marital status and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status. The second aim was to determine how much of the total variance of the walking and physical activity outcomes can be attributed to neighborhood-level differences. Neighborhood walkability was objectively measured by GIS methods. An index consisting of residential density, street connectivity, and land use mix was constructed to define 32 highly and less walkable neighborhoods in Stockholm City. MVPA was measured objectively during 7 days with an accelerometer and walking was assessed using the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Multilevel linear as well as logistic models (mixed-effects, mixed-distribution models) were used in the analysis. The statistically significant and “adjusted” results for individuals living in highly walkable neighborhoods, as compared to those living in less walkable neighborhoods, were: (1) 77\% and 28\% higher odds for walking for active transportation and walking for leisure, respectively, (2) 50 min more walking for active transportation/week, and (3) 3.1 min more MVPA/day. The proportion of the total variance at the neighborhood level was low and ranged between 0.0\% and 2.1\% in the adjusted models. The findings of the present study stress that future policies concerning the built environment must be based on context-specific evidence, particularly in the light of the fact that neighborhood redevelopments are time-consuming and expensive.},

Residents in neighbourhoods with the furthest access to a multinational fast-food outlet were more likely to eat the recommended intake of vegetables but also be overweight. There was no association with fruit consumption. Access to locally operated fast-food outlets was not associated with the consumption of the recommended fruit and vegetables or being overweight.

	abstract = {Objective. This paper explores which of absolute (i.e. densities of “healthy” and “unhealthy” food outlets taken separately) or relative (i.e. the percentage of “healthy” outlets) measures of foodscape exposure better predicts fruit and vegetable intake (FVI), and whether those associations are modiﬁed by gender and city in Canada.
Methods. Self-reported FVI from participants of four cycles (2007–2010) of the repeated cross-sectional Canadian Community Health Survey living in the ﬁve largest metropolitan areas of Canada (n = 49,403) was analyzed. Absolute and relative measures of foodscape exposure were computed at participants' residential postal codes. Linear regression models, both in the whole sample and in gender- and city-stratiﬁed samples, were used to explore the associations between exposure measures and FVI.
Results. The percentage of healthy outlets was strongly associated with FVI among men both in Toronto/ Montreal (β = 0.012; P b 0.001), and in Calgary/Ottawa/Vancouver (β = 0.008; P b 0.001), but not among women. Observed associations of absolute measures with FVI were either weak or faced multicollinearity issues. Overall, models with the relative measure showed the best ﬁt.
Conclusions. Relative measures should be more widely used when assessing foodscape inﬂuences on diet. The absence of a single effect of the foodscape on diet positions sub-group analysis as a promising avenue for research. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Greater distance to full-service supermarkets and low income may impair access to healthy diets and contribute to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension. The study aim was to determine relationships among residence in a “food desert,” low income, CKD, and blood pressure.

Methods
Adults in the 2003–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N=22,173) were linked to food desert data (www.ers.usda.gov) by Census Tracts. Food deserts have low median income and are further from a supermarket or large grocery store ({\textgreater}1 mile in urban areas, {\textgreater}10 miles in rural areas). Weighted regression was used to determine the association of residence in a food desert and family income with dietary intake, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and odds of CKD. Data analysis was performed in 2014–2015.

Results
Compared with those not in food deserts, participants residing in food deserts had lower levels of serum carotenoids (p{\textless}0.01), a biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake, and higher SBP (1.53 mmHg higher, 95\% CI=0.41, 2.66) after adjustment for demographics and income. Residence in a food desert was not associated with odds of CKD (OR=1.20, 95\% CI=0.96, 1.49). Lower, versus higher, income was associated with lower serum carotenoids (p{\textless}0.01) and higher SBP (2.00 mmHg higher for income–poverty ratio ≤1 vs {\textgreater}3, 95\% CI=1.12, 2.89), but also greater odds of CKD (OR=1.76 for income–poverty ratio ≤1 vs {\textgreater}3, 95\% CI=1.48, 2.10).

Conclusions
Limited access to healthy food due to geographic or financial barriers could be targeted for prevention of CKD and hypertension.},

	abstract = {Background
Lack of access to healthy foods may explain why residents of low-income neighborhoods and African Americans in the U.S. have high rates of obesity. The findings on where people shop and how that may influence health are mixed. However, multiple policy initiatives are underway to increase access in communities that currently lack healthy options. Few studies have simultaneously measured obesity, distance, and prices of the store used for primary food shopping.

Purpose
To examine the relationship among distance to store, food prices, and obesity.

Methods
The Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Eating, Shopping, and Health study conducted baseline interviews with 1,372 households between May and December 2011 in two low-income, majority African American neighborhoods without a supermarket. Audits of 16 stores where participants reported doing their major food shopping were conducted. Data were analyzed between February 2012 and February 2013.

Results
Distance to store and prices were positively associated with obesity (p{\textless}0.05). When distance to store and food prices were jointly modeled, only prices remained significant (p{\textless}0.01), with higher prices predicting a lower likelihood of obesity. Although low- and high-price stores did not differ in availability, they significantly differed in their display and marketing of junk foods relative to healthy foods.

Conclusions
Placing supermarkets in food deserts to improve access may not be as important as simultaneously offering better prices for healthy foods relative to junk foods, actively marketing healthy foods, and enabling consumers to resist the influence of junk food marketing.},

Neighborhood differences in access to food may have an important inﬂuence on these relationships and health disparities in the U.S. This article reviews research relating to the presence, nature, and implications of neighborhood differences in access to food.
Methods: A snowball strategy was used to identify relevant research studies (nϭ54) completed in the U.S. and published between 1985 and April 2008.
Results: Research suggests that neighborhood residents who have better access to supermarkets and limited access to convenience stores tend to have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. Results from studies examining the accessibility of restaurants are less consistent, but there is some evidence to suggest that residents with limited access to fast-food restaurants have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. National and local studies across the U.S. suggest that residents of low-income, minority, and rural neighborhoods are most often affected by poor access to supermarkets and healthful food. In contrast, the availability of fast-food restaurants and energy-dense foods has been found to be greater in lower-income and minority neighborhoods.
Conclusions: Neighborhood disparities in access to food are of great concern because of their potential},

The main findings were that high- and moderate-deprivation neighborhoods had a significantly higher prevalence of all types of goods, services, and resources than low-deprivation neighborhoods. These findings do not support previous research that hypothesizes that poorer health among people in deprived neighborhoods is explained by a lack of health-promoting resources, although a higher presence of health-damaging resources may play a role.},

The follow-up period ran from January 1, 2005, until hospitalisation/out-patient treatment for obesity, death, emigration or the end of the study period on December 31, 2010.

Design: Follow up study from 31 December 1995 to 31 December 1999. Women and men were analysed separately with respect to incidence rates of coronary heart disease. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics (age, individual income) at the first level and level of neighbourhood deprivation at the second level. Neighbourhood deprivation was measured at small area market statistics level by the use of Care Need Index. Setting: Sweden. Participants: All women and men aged 40-64 in the Swedish population, in total 2.6 million people. Main results: There was a strong relation between level of neighbourhood deprivation and incidence rates of coronary heart disease for both women and men. In the full model, which took account of individual income, the risk of developing coronary heart disease was 87\% higher for women and 42\% higher for men in the most deprived neighbourhoods than in the most affluent neighbourhoods. For both women and men the variance at neighbourhood level was over twice the standard error, indicating significant differences in coronary heart disease risk between neighbourhoods. Conclusions: High levels of neighbourhood deprivation independently predict coronary heart disease for both women and men. Both individual and neighbourhood level approaches are important in health care policies.},

The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action.

Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23·8\% (22·9–24·7) of boys and 22·6\% (21·7–23·6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8·1\% (7·7–8·6) to 12·9\% (12·3–13·5) in 2013 for boys and from 8·4\% (8·1–8·8) to 13·4\% (13·0–13·9) in girls.

Previous attempts to summarise the literature have not systematically assessed the methodological quality of included studies, or accounted for environmental differences between continents or the ways in which environmental characteristics were measured.
Methods: We have conducted an updated review of the scientific literature on associations of physical environmental factors with adult weight status, stratified by continent and mode of measurement, accompanied by a detailed risk-of-bias assessment. Five databases were systematically searched for studies published between 1995 and 2013.
Results: Two factors, urban sprawl and land use mix, were found consistently associated with weight status, although only in North America.
Conclusions: With the exception of urban sprawl and land use mix in the US the results of the current review confirm that the available research does not allow robust identification of ways in which that physical environment influences adult weight status, even after taking into account methodological quality.},

This renewed interest in health pro motion and disease prevention has not been without its critics. Some critics have accused proponents of life-style interventions of promoting a victim-blaming ideology by neglecting the importance of social influences on health and disease., This article proposes an ecological model for health promotion which focuses atten tion on both individual and social environmental factors as targets for health promo tion interventions. It addresses the importance of interventions directed at changing interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy, factors which support and maintain unhealthy behaviors. The model assumes that appropriate changes in the social environment will produce changes in individuals, and that the support of individ uals in the population is essential for implementing environmental changes.},

Multilevel or contextual analyses of social factors and health represent a possible reconciliation between two divergent epidemiological paradigms-individual risk factor epidemiology and an ecological approach. Data sources-Keyword searching of Index Medicus (Medline) and additional references from retrieved articles. Study selection-All original studies of the effect of local area social characteristics on individual health outcomes, adjusted for individual socioeconomic status, published in English before 1 June 1998 and focused on populations in developed countries. Data synthesis-The methodological challenges posed by the design and interpretation of multilevel studies of local area effects are discussed and results summarised with reference to type of health outcome. All but two of the 25 reviewed studies reported a statistically significant association between at least one measure of social environment and a health outcome (contextual effect), after adjusting for individual level socioeconomic status (compositional effect). Contextual effects were generally modest and much smaller than compositional effects. Conclusions-The evidence for modest neighbourhood effects on health is fairly consistent despite heterogeneity of study designs, substitution of local area measures for neighbourhood measures and probable measurement error. By drawing public health attention to the health risks associated with the social structure and ecology of neighbourhoods, innovative approaches to community level interventions may ensue.},

It imposes huge financial burdens on health care systems and the community at large. Obesity develops over time and once it has done so, is difficult to treat. Therefore, the prevention of weight gain offers the only truly effective means of controlling obesity. Very little research has directly addressed the issue of obesity prevention and previous efforts to prevent obesity amongst individuals, groups or whole communities have had very limited success. However, we have learned sufficient from past preventive activities to realise that the management of obesity will require a comprehensive range of strategies with actions that target those with existing weight problems, those at high risk of developing obesity as well as the community as a whole. The prevention and management of obesity in children should be considered a priority as there is a high risk of persistence into adulthood.},

The upper component distributions corresponded to overweight or obesity in samples of middle-aged or older individuals. A bivariate analysis demonstrated that, while monozygotic co-twins appeared to be drawn from the same component distributions (normal or overweight), the twin correlations varied across components, with the lowest correlation in the overweight group. While these analyses cannot provide a definitive test of competing genetic and environmental hypotheses, this approach is useful for generating hypotheses about the causes of obesity. When combined with other published literature, our results suggest that the genetic background largely determines the propensity to become obese. Whether a predisposed person becomes obese and the extent of obesity depend on environmental exposures that are largely independent of early family experience. Both genes and environment appear to be important in obesity, but it appears that some genotypes may be much more sensitive to the environment than are others.},

There was no relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their adoptive parents. Cumulative distributions of the body-mass index of parents showed similar results; there was a strong relation between the body-mass index of biologic parents and adoptee weight class and no relation between the index of adoptive parents and adoptee weight class. Furthermore, the relation between biologic parents and adoptees was not confined to the obesity weight class, but was present across the whole range of body fatness - from very thin to very fat.

No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7·0\% [95\% uncertainty interval 6·2–7·7] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6·3\% [5·5–7·0]), and household air pollution from solid fuels (4·3\% [3·4–5·3]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7·9\% [6·8–9·4]), household air pollution from solid fuels (HAP; 6·8\% [5·5–8·0]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6·1\% [5·4–6·8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10·0\% (95\% UI 9·2–10·8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0·9\% (0·4–1·6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, Andean Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, most of Latin America, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Overweight and obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States and most likely contribute substantially to the burden of chronic health conditions.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between weight status and prevalence of health conditions by severity of overweight and obesity in the US population.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationally representative cross-sectional survey using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which was conducted in 2 phases from 1988 to 1994.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 16884 adults, 25 years and older, classified as overweight and obese (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater} or =25 kg/m2) based on National Institutes of Health recommended guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis.
RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of men and 55\% of women had a body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater. A graded increase in the prevalence ratio (PR) was observed with increasing severity of overweight and obesity for all of the health outcomes except for coronary heart disease in men and high blood cholesterol level in both men and women. With normal-weight individuals as the reference, for individuals with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m2 and who were younger than 55 years, PRs were highest for type 2 diabetes for men (PR, 18.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-46.8) and women (PR, 12.9; 95\% CI, 5.7-28.1) and gallbladder disease for men (PR, 21.1; 95\% CI, 4.1-84.2) and women (PR, 5.2; 95\% CI, 2.9-8.9). Prevalence ratios generally were greater in younger than in older adults. The prevalence of having 2 or more health conditions increased with weight status category across all racial and ethnic subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, more than half of all US adults are considered overweight or obese. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities emphasizes the need for concerted efforts to prevent and treat obesity rather than just its associated comorbidities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excess bodyweight is a major public health concern. However, few worldwide comparative analyses of long-term trends of body-mass index (BMI) have been done, and none have used recent national health examination surveys. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean BMI.
METHODS: We estimated trends and their uncertainties of mean BMI for adults 20 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (960 country-years and 9·1 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean BMI by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.
FINDINGS: Between 1980 and 2008, mean BMI worldwide increased by 0·4 kg/m(2) per decade (95\% uncertainty interval 0·2-0·6, posterior probability of being a true increase {\textgreater}0·999) for men and 0·5 kg/m(2) per decade (0·3-0·7, posterior probability {\textgreater}0·999) for women. National BMI change for women ranged from non-significant decreases in 19 countries to increases of more than 2·0 kg/m(2) per decade (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·99) in nine countries in Oceania. Male BMI increased in all but eight countries, by more than 2 kg/m(2) per decade in Nauru and Cook Islands (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·999). Male and female BMIs in 2008 were highest in some Oceania countries, reaching 33·9 kg/m(2) (32·8-35·0) for men and 35·0 kg/m(2) (33·6-36·3) for women in Nauru. Female BMI was lowest in Bangladesh (20·5 kg/m(2), 19·8-21·3) and male BMI in Democratic Republic of the Congo 19·9 kg/m(2) (18·2-21·5), with BMI less than 21·5 kg/m(2) for both sexes in a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and east, south, and southeast Asia. The USA had the highest BMI of high-income countries. In 2008, an estimated 1·46 billion adults (1·41-1·51 billion) worldwide had BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or greater, of these 205 million men (193-217 million) and 297 million women (280-315 million) were obese.
INTERPRETATION: Globally, mean BMI has increased since 1980. The trends since 1980, and mean population BMI in 2008, varied substantially between nations. Interventions and policies that can curb or reverse the increase, and mitigate the health effects of high BMI by targeting its metabolic mediators, are needed in most countries.

The simultaneous increases in obesity in almost all countries seem to be driven mainly by changes in the global food system, which is producing more processed, affordable, and effectively marketed food than ever before. This passive overconsumption of energy leading to obesity is a predictable outcome of market economies predicated on consumption-based growth. The global food system drivers interact with local environmental factors to create a wide variation in obesity prevalence between populations. Within populations, the interactions between environmental and individual factors, including genetic makeup, explain variability in body size between individuals. However, even with this individual variation, the epidemic has predictable patterns in subpopulations. In low-income countries, obesity mostly affects middle-aged adults (especially women) from wealthy, urban environments; whereas in high-income countries it affects both sexes and all ages, but is disproportionately greater in disadvantaged groups. Unlike other major causes of preventable death and disability, such as tobacco use, injuries, and infectious diseases, there are no exemplar populations in which the obesity epidemic has been reversed by public health measures. This absence increases the urgency for evidence-creating policy action, with a priority on reduction of the supply-side drivers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relation between socioeconomic status and mortality. Over the past several decades death rates in the United States have declined, but it is unclear whether all socioeconomic groups have benefited equally.
METHODS: Using records from the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey (n = 13,491) and the 1986 National Health Interview Survey (n = 30,725), we replicated the analysis by Kitagawa and Hauser of differential mortality in 1960. We calculated direct standardized mortality rates and indirect standardized mortality ratios for persons 25 to 64 years of age according to race, sex, income, and family status.
RESULTS: The inverse relation between mortality and socioeconomic status persisted in 1986 and was stronger than in 1960. The disparity in mortality rates according to income and education increased for men and women, whites and blacks, and family members and unrelated persons. Over the 26-year period, the inequalities according to educational level increased for whites and blacks by over 20 percent in women and by over 100 percent in men. In whites, absolute death rates declined in persons of all educational levels, but the reduction was greater for men and women with more education than for those with less.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite an overall decline in death rates in the United States since 1960, poor and poorly educated people still die at higher rates than those with higher incomes or better educations, and this disparity increased between 1960 and 1986.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The two step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method has emerged in the last decade as a key measure of spatial accessibility, particularly in its application to primary health care access. Many recent 'improvements' to the original 2SFCA method have been developed, which generally either account for distance-decay within a catchment or enable the usage of variable catchment sizes. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of various proposed methods within these two improvement groups. Moreover, its assessment focuses on how well these improvements operate within and between rural and metropolitan populations over large geographical regions.
RESULTS: Demonstrating these improvements to the whole state of Victoria, Australia, this paper presents the first comparison between continuous and zonal (step) decay functions and specifically their effect within both rural and metropolitan populations. Especially in metropolitan populations, the application of either type of distance-decay function is shown to be problematic by itself. Its inclusion necessitates the addition of a variable catchment size function which can enable the 2SFCA method to dynamically define more appropriate catchments which align with actual health service supply and utilisation.
CONCLUSION: This study assesses recent 'improvements' to the 2SFCA when applied over large geographic regions of both large and small populations. Its findings demonstrate the necessary combination of both a distance-decay function and variable catchment size function in order for the 2SFCA to appropriately measure healthcare access across all geographical regions.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12913-017-2367-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For achieving equity of the accessibility to primary healthcare, measuring potential geographical accessibility is essential. The provider-to-population ratio is the most frequently used measure. However, it is difficult to be used in closer region because it does not take into consideration the people and health services beyond its boundary. In order to overcome this problem, we measured the potential access to hospital, using both distance measures and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. The aim of this study was to compare the number of hospitals in the neighborhood and the E2SFCA score with regard to the amount and equity for access to hospitals.
METHODS: This descriptive study used publicly available data from 2010. The E2SFCA score and number of neighborhood hospitals were obtained from Tochigi province in Japan using a geographic information system. Dataset of four measures by each census tract was obtained. The measures were E2SFCA score, number of hospitals within the 5 km range, number of hospitals within the 10 km range, and number of hospitals within the 15 km range. Correlation and disparity analyses with the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient were performed.
RESULTS: The measures were obtained in a smaller area than municipality considering adjacent areas using a geographical approach. The E2SFCA score was 5.3 [3.2-7.3] hospitals/million (median [quantile range]), compared to 5.6 hospitals/million in total for the given district. The median number of hospitals within the 5 km, 10 km, and 15 km ranges were 1, 39, and 47, respectively. There was no hospital within the 5 km range in one third of the blocks. Both the number of hospitals within the 10 km range and those within the 15 km range were well correlated. Regional difference became smaller as the distance to count the number of hospitals increased. The gap between small number of hospitals and the high E2SFCA score indicated the location of community hospital in depopulated areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The E2SFCA method is superior for analyzing spatial access to hospital, because it provides information in the closer sub-regions. Regional differences were hardly seen in access to hospital beyond the 10 km range. Further studies in other regions and countries are needed for precise assessment.},

This paper proposes methodological enhancements to increase the sophistication of the 2SFCA methodology by incorporating both public and private transport modes using dedicated network datasets. The proposed model yields separate accessibility scores for each modal group at each demand point to better reflect the differential accessibility levels experienced by each cohort. An empirical study of primary health care facilities in South Wales, UK, is used to illustrate the approach. Outcomes suggest the bus-riding cohort of each census tract experience much lower accessibility levels than those estimated by an undifferentiated (car-only) model. Car drivers' accessibility may also be misrepresented in an undifferentiated model because they potentially profit from the lower demand placed upon service provision points by bus riders. The ability to specify independent catchment sizes for each cohort in the multi-modal model allows aspects of preparedness to travel to be investigated.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many rural communities continue to experience an undersupply of primary care doctor services. While key professional factors relating to difficulties of recruitment and retention of rural primary care doctors are widely identified, less attention has been given to the role of community and place aspects on supply. Place-related attributes contribute to a community's overall amenity or attractiveness, which arguably influence both rural recruitment and retention relocation decisions of doctors. This bi-national study of Australia and the USA, two developed nations with similar geographic and rural access profiles, investigates the extent to which variations in community amenity indicators are associated with spatial variations in the supply of rural primary care doctors.
METHODS: Measures from two dimensions of community amenity: geographic location, specifically isolation/proximity; and economics and sociodemographics were included in this study, along with a proxy measure (jurisdiction) of a third dimension, environmental amenity. Data were chiefly collated from the American Community Survey and the Australian Census of Population and Housing, with additional calculated proximity measures. Rural primary care supply was measured using provider-to-population ratios in 1949 US rural counties and in 370 Australian rural local government areas. Additionally, the more sophisticated two-step floating catchment area method was used to measure Australian rural primary care supply in 1116 rural towns, with population sizes ranging from 500 to 50 000. Associations between supply and community amenity indicators were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficients and ordinary least squares multiple linear regression models.
RESULTS: It was found that increased population size, having a hospital in the county, increased house prices and affluence, and a more educated and older population were all significantly associated with increased workforce supply across rural areas of both countries. While remote areas were strongly linked with poorer supply in Australia, geographical remoteness was not significant after accounting for other indicators of amenity such as the positive association between workforce supply and coastal location. Workforce supply in the USA was negatively associated with fringe rural area locations adjacent to larger metropolitan areas and characterised by long work commutes. The US model captured 49\% of the variation of workforce supply between rural counties, while the Australian models captured 35-39\% of rural supply variation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support the idea that the rural medical workforce is maldistributed with a skew towards locating in more affluent and educated areas, and against locating in smaller, poorer and more isolated rural towns, which struggle to attract an adequate supply of primary care services. This evidence is important in understanding the role of place characteristics and rural population dynamics in the recruitment and retention of rural doctors. Future primary care workforce policies need to place a greater focus on rural communities that, for a variety of reasons, may be less attractive to doctors looking to begin or remain working there.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date, nearly all research on physical activity and the built environment is based on self-reported physical activity and perceived assessment of the built environment.
OBJECTIVE: To assess how objectively measured levels of physical activity are related with objectively measured aspects of the physical environment around each participant's home while controlling for sociodemographic covariates.
METHODS: Objective measures of the built environment unique to each household's physical location were developed within a geographic information system to assess land-use mix, residential density, and street connectivity. These measures were then combined into a walkability index. Accelerometers were deployed over a 2-day period to capture objective levels of physical activity in 357 adults.
RESULTS: Measures of land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density were positively related with number of minutes of moderate physical activity per day. A combined walkability index of these urban form factors was significant (p =0.002) and explained additional variation in the number of minutes of moderate activity per day over sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-seven percent of individuals in the highest walkability index quartile met the {\textgreater} or =30 minutes of physical activity recommended, compared to only 18\% of individuals in the lowest walkability quartile. Individuals in the highest walkability quartile were 2.4 times more likely (confidence interval=1.18-4.88) than individuals in the lowest walkability quartile to meet the recommended {\textgreater} or =30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day.
CONCLUSIONS: This research supports the hypothesis that community design is significantly associated with moderate levels of physical activity. These results support the rationale for the development of policy that promotes increased levels of land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density as interventions that can have lasting public health benefits.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mounting evidence documents the importance of urban form for active travel, but international studies could strengthen the evidence. The aim of the study was to document the strength, shape, and generalizability of relations of objectively measured built environment variables with transport-related walking and cycling.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study maximized variation of environments and demographics by including multiple countries and by selecting adult participants living in neighborhoods based on higher and lower classifications of objectively measured walkability and socioeconomic status. Analyses were conducted on 12,181 adults aged 18-66 years, drawn from 14 cities across 10 countries worldwide. Frequency of transport-related walking and cycling over the last seven days was assessed by questionnaire and four objectively measured built environment variables were calculated. Associations of built environment variables with transport-related walking and cycling variables were estimated using generalized additive mixed models, and were tested for curvilinearity and study site moderation.
RESULTS: We found positive associations of walking for transport with all the environmental attributes, but also found that the relationships was only linear for land use mix, but not for residential density, intersection density, and the number of parks. Our findings suggest that there may be optimum values in these attributes, beyond which higher densities or number of parks could have minor or even negative impact. Cycling for transport was associated linearly with residential density, intersection density (only for any cycling), and land use mix, but not with the number of parks.
CONCLUSION: Across 14 diverse cities and countries, living in more densely populated areas, having a well-connected street network, more diverse land uses, and having more parks were positively associated with transport-related walking and/or cycling. Except for land-use-mix, all built environment variables had curvilinear relationships with walking, with a plateau in the relationship at higher levels of the scales.},

	abstract = {Although both geographic accessibility and socioeconomic status have been indicated as being important factors for the utilization of health care services, their combined effect has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to reveal whether an income-dependent difference in the impact of geographic accessibility on the utilization of government-led annual health check-ups exists. Existing data collected and provided by Chiba City Hall were employed and analyzed as a retrospective cohort study. The subjects were 166,966 beneficiaries of National Health Insurance in Chiba City, Japan, aged 40 to 74 years. Of all subjects, 54,748 (32.8\%) had an annual health check-up in fiscal year 2012. As an optimal index of geographic accessibility has not been established, five measures were calculated: travel time to the nearest health care facility, density of health care facilities (number facilities within a 30-min walking distance from the district of residence), and three indices based on the two-step floating catchment area method. Three-level logistic regression modeling with random intercepts for household and district of residence was performed. Of the five measures, density of health care facilities was the most compatible according to Akaike's information criterion. Both low density and low income were associated with decreased utilization of the health check-ups. Furthermore, a linear relationship was observed between the density of facilities and utilization of the health check-ups in all income groups and its slope was significantly steeper among subjects with an equivalent income of 0.00 yen than among those with equivalent income of 1.01-2.00 million yen (p = 0.028) or 2.01 million yen or more (p = 0.040). This result indicated that subjects with lower incomes were more susceptible to the effects of geographic accessibility than were those with higher incomes. Thus, better geographic accessibility could increase the health check-up utilization and also decrease the income-related disparity of utilization.},

We identified hospital sites serving English PCTs (Primary Care Trusts) with the management and treatment of breast, lung and colorectal cancer. Geographical access was estimated as travel time in minutes from LSOAs (Lower Super Output Areas) to the nearest hospital site and aggregated to PCT level. Correlations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer cases were estimated using Spearman's rank correlation. Associations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer relative survival rates were estimated using linear regression with adjustment for area deprivation and for a PCT level measure of the reported ease of obtaining a doctor's appointment. We found that cancer services tended to be located farther from areas with more cancer cases, and longer average travel times are associated with worse survival after adjustment for age, sex, year and area deprivation. This suggests that geographical access to cancer services remains a concern in England.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because most adults in industrialized countries do not meet physical activity guidelines, population-wide interventions are needed. Environmental and policy interventions are based on ecological models of behavior and have the potential to influence entire populations. Ecological models are particularly applicable to physical activity because the behavior must be done in specific physical settings. Cross-sectional data indicate that environmental and policy variables are associated with physical activity behaviors of young people and adults.
METHOD: Seven published evaluations of environmental and policy interventions to increase physical activity were reviewed.
RESULTS: Two studies showed that placing signs encouraging stair use can be effective. Quasi-experimental evaluations provided limited evidence that broad environmental changes can be effective. Large-scale policy interventions are currently being conducted in several countries. PROPOSED MODEL: A model describing the development of policy and environmental interventions is proposed, in the hope of stimulating more research in this area. Advocacy or planning groups identify and work with agencies that control policies and environments that can be altered to increase physical activity. Educational and policy/environmental interventions are seen as complementary.
CONCLUSION: Lack of conceptual models and the inherent difficulties of evaluation have hampered research on environmental and policy interventions. Further research is needed, and practitioners and researchers should work together to evaluate programs.},

	abstract = {Background
Assessing neighborhood environment in access to mammography remains a challenge when investigating its contextual effect on breast cancer-related outcomes. Studies using different Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based measures reported inconsistent findings.

Methods
We compared GIS-based measures (travel time, service density, and a two-Step Floating Catchment Area method [2SFCA]) of access to FDA-accredited mammography facilities in terms of their Spearman correlation, agreement (Kappa) and spatial patterns. As an indicator of predictive validity, we examined their association with the odds of late-stage breast cancer using cancer registry data.

Results
The accessibility measures indicated considerable variation in correlation, Kappa and spatial pattern. Measures using shortest travel time (or average) and service density showed low correlations, no agreement, and different spatial patterns. Both types of measures showed low correlations and little agreement with the 2SFCA measures. Of all measures, only the two measures using 6-timezone-weighted 2SFCA method were associated with increased odds of late-stage breast cancer (quick-distance-decay: odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.32; slow-distance-decay: OR = 1.19, 95\% CI = 1.03–1.37) after controlling for demographics and neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation.

Conclusions
Various GIS-based measures of access to mammography facilities exist and are not identical in principle and their association with late-stage breast cancer risk. Only the two measures using the 2SFCA method with 6-timezone weighting were associated with increased odds of late-stage breast cancer. These measures incorporate both travel barriers and service competition. Studies may observe different results depending on the measure of accessibility used.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND- Individuals living in primary care health professional shortage areas (PC-HPSA), often have difficulty obtaining medical care; however, no previous studies have examined association of pc-hpsa residence with prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS- To examine this question, the authors used data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis baseline examination (2000-2002). Outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity as well as the awareness and control of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Multivariable Poisson models were used to examine the independent association of PC-HPSA residence with each outcome. Models were sequentially adjusted for demographics, acculturation, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Similar to the national average, 16.7\% of Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants lived in a PC-HPSA. In unadjusted analyses, prevalence rates of diabetes (14.8\% versus 11.0\%), hypertension (48.2\% versus 43.1\%), obesity (35.7\% versus 31.1\%), and smoking (15.5\% versus 12.1\%) were significantly higher among residents of PC-HPSAs. There were no significant differences in the awareness or control of diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. After adjustment, residence in a PC-HPSA was not independently associated with cardiovascular disease risk factor prevalence, awareness, or control. CONCLUSIONS- This study suggests that increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in PC-HPSAs are explained by the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of their residents. Future interventions aimed at increasing the number of primary care physicians may not improve cardiovascular risk without first addressing other factors underlying health care disparities.},

	abstract = {Assessing access to healthcare for an entire healthcare system involves accounting for demand, supply, and geographic variation. In order to capture the interaction between healthcare services and populations, various measures of healthcare access have been utilized, including the popular two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. However, despite the many advantages of 2SFCA, the problems, such as inappropriate assumption of healthcare demand and failure to capture cascading effects across the system have not been satisfactorily addressed. In this paper, a statistical model for evaluating flows of individuals was added to the 2SFCA method (hereafter we refer to it as F2SFCA) in order to overcome limitations associated with its current restriction. The proposed F2SFCA model can incorporate both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and thus synthesizes them into one framework. Moreover, the proposed F2SFCA model can be easily adapted to measure access for different types of individuals, over different service provider types, or with capacity constraints in a healthcare system. We implemented the proposed model in a case study assessing access to healthcare for the elderly in Taipei City, Taiwan, and compared the weaknesses and strengths to the 2SFCA method and its variations.},

It was hypothesized, in this study, that income inequality is related to reduction in social cohesion and that disinvestment in social capital is in turn associated with increased mortality. METHODS: In this cross-sectional ecologic study based on data from 39 states, social capital was measured by weighted responses to two items from the General Social Survey: per capita density of membership in voluntary groups in each state and level of social trust, as gauged by the proportion of residents in each state who believed that people could be trusted. Age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates in 1990 were obtained for each state. RESULTS: Income inequality was strongly correlated with both per capita group membership (r = -.46) and lack of social trust (r = .76). In turn, both social trust and group membership were associated with total mortality, as well as rates of death from coronary heart disease, malignant neoplasms, and infant mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that income inequality leads to increased mortality via disinvestment in social capital.},

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional population study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A mobility score was based on responses to items referring to body movements, walking, moving around and using transportation. Determinants of mobility were entered in hierarchical regression models in the following order: sociodemographic characteristics, health habits, chronic conditions, description of general state of health, vision and hearing, social networks, built environment.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 3902 participants (mean age 65.1, SD 9.8). The final model explained 64.7\% of the variation in mobility. The most relevant predictors were: pain, age and living in Finland, presence of arthritis, stroke and diabetes, high-risk waist circumference, physical inactivity, and perceiving the neighborhood environment as more exploitable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide public health indications that could support concrete actions to address the modifiable determinants of mobility. These include the identification and treatment of pain-related problems, increasing the level of physical activity and the improvement of neighborhood features in terms of presence of general utility places or means of transportation. These factors can be modified with short- to medium-term interventions and such a change could improve the mobility of ageing population, with evident benefits for health.},

Older blacks experienced more affective pain, pain-related disability and mood disorder symptoms than older whites. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed previously hypothesized factors for the McGill Pain Questionnaire pain dimensions and the Pain Disability Index. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses also identified factors in the Brief Symptom Inventory and neighborhood SES. Structural equation modeling showed black race was associated with lower neighborhood SES and also with increased affective pain, obligatory disability and mood disorders mediationally through neighborhood SES. It was indirectly associated with increased sensory and miscellaneous pain, and voluntary disability through low neighborhood SES. Racial interaction examination showed that neighborhood SES had the same relationship to outcomes by race.

Its management in the community remains generally unsatisfactory, partly because of lack of evidence for effective interventions. Epidemiological study of chronic pain, through an understanding of its distribution and determinants, can inform the development, targeting, and evaluation of interventions in the general population. This paper reviews current knowledge of risk markers associated with chronic pain and considers how these might inform management and prevention.

	abstract = {Chronic pain is highly prevalent among older adults where it is associated with significant suffering, disability, social isolation, and greater costs and burden to health care systems. Pharmaceutical treatment of chronic pain in older adults is usually only partially effective and is often limited by side effects including urinary retention, constipation, sedation, cognitive impairment, and increased risk of falls. Since older adults are underrepresented in clinical trials testing treatments for chronic pain, the potential impacts of polypharmacy and frailty on reported outcomes and side effect profiles are largely unknown. Thus, for current treatments, providers and patients must balance anticipated benefits of pain reduction with the known and unknown risks of treatment. Chronic pain is also a risk factor for premature death as well as accelerated cognitive decline, suggesting potential shared mechanisms between persistent pain (or its treatment) and dementia. Cognitive decline and dementia may also impact pain perception and the ability to report pain, complicating treatment decisions. Associations between persistent pain and the risks of premature death and accelerated cognitive decline make estimates for chronic pain in these populations particularly challenging. Future research is needed to improve estimates for chronic pain in older adults, to elucidate underlying mechanisms of pain with aging, and to develop and advance safer, more effective treatment options for chronic pain in older adults.},

Methods A population-based cross-sectional survey of community-dwelling older adults was carried out in Unnan City, Shimane Prefecture, in Japan. A total of 499 men and women aged 60 years and older living in the community were recruited from 2008 to 2010. The main outcome measures were self-rated recent trip frequency and self-reported experience of falls in the past year. Results Trips and falls presented in 44.0\% and 15.9\% of participants, respectively. LBP was not associated with trips, but was significantly associated with falls: severe pain versus single fall (odds ratio [OR] 2.51, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–6.03); and severe pain versus multiple falls (OR 11.09, 95\% CI 2.41–51.10). KP was significantly associated with trips: mild pain versus trips (OR 1.81, 95\% CI 1.20–2.72); mild pain versus multiple falls (OR 4.47, 95\% CI 1.21–16.50); severe pain versus trips (OR 3.83, 95\% CI 1.82–8.04); and severe pain versus multiple falls (OR 7.26, 95\% CI 1.51–34.86). Participants with both pain sites were associated with trips (OR 2.44, 95\% CI 1.45–4.12) and multiple falls (OR 10.79, 95\% CI 1.33–87.19). Conclusions Severe LBP was associated with single and multiple falls, whereas KP was associated with trips and multiple falls, irrespective of severity of pain.

	abstract = {It is known that overweight is associated with chronic knee pain (CKP) and chronic low back pain (CLBP). Several risk factors for these conditions have been postulated, including age, sex, overweight, occupation, and socioeconomic factors.  In addition, physical environment has been studied as a potential risk factor in recent years. However, the associations of overweight and physical environment with CKP and CLBP remains unclear. The aim of this study conducted in a rural mountainous region was to examine whether overweight individuals living at higher elevations have an increased probability of experiencing CKP and CLBP. In 2009, we conducted a mail survey with a random sample aged between 40 to 79 years. Questionnaires were sent to 6,000 individuals and a total of 4,559 individuals responded to this survey. After excluding the respondents with missing data, we conducted a logistic regression analysis of the data for 3,109 individuals. There was statistically significantly higher adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of CKP for those who were overweight living at low elevation (aOR = 1.90, 95\% CI = 1.21–2.98),  moderate elevation (aOR = 1.73, 95\% CI = 1.05–2.87), and high elevation (aOR = 2.13, 95\% CI = 1.31–3.46) than those who were not overweight living at low elevation. However, similar patterns were not observed for CLBP. Our results show that specific overweight–elevation associations were observed for CKP in a rural mountainous region.},

	abstract = {Background: Both little and excessive physical activity (PA) may relate to chronic musculoskeletal pain. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the relationship of PA levels with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and chronic knee pain (CKP).Methods: We evaluated 4559 adults aged 40–79 years in a community-based cross-sectional survey conducted in 2009 in Shimane, Japan. We used self-administered questionnaires to assess sociodemographics and health status: PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and CLBP and CKP were assessed by a modified version of the Knee Pain Screening Tool. We examined relationships of PA with prevalence of CLBP and CKP using Poisson regression, controlling for potential confounders.Results: CLBP and CKP were both prevalent (14.1\% and 10.7\%, respectively) and associated with history of injury, medication use, and consultation with physicians. PA was not significantly related to CLBP or CKP (P {\textgreater} 0.05) before or after adjustment for potential confounders. For example, compared with adults reporting moderate PA (8.25–23.0 MET-hours/week), prevalence ratios for CKP adjusted for sex, age, education years, self-rated health, depressive symptom, smoking, chronic disease history, and body-mass index were 1.12 (95\% confidential interval [CI] 0.84–1.50) among those with the lowest PA and 1.26 (95\% CI 0.93–1.70) among those with the highest PA (P quadratic = 0.08). The prevalence ratios were further attenuated toward the null after additional adjustment for history of injury, medication use, and consultation (P quadratic = 0.17).Conclusions: This cross-sectional study showed that there were no significant linear or quadratic relationships of self-reported PA with CLBP and CKP.

In sensitivity analyses with change in MGS as the continuous variable, the association was not significant, but a similar negative association with knee pain was confirmed (mild pain β = −0.040, severe pain β = −0.088; P for trend = 0.104). In addition, older adults with knee pain at both baseline and follow up had a higher risk of meaningful decline in MGS (IRR 2.33, 95\% CI 1.59–3.40) compared with those who had no pain at baseline or follow up.

	abstract = {Background
The positive health effects of physical activity are well known. However, there are few studies of the association between different levels of physical activity and all-cause mortality among elderly people.
Methods
A national random sample of 3206 women and men aged ≥65 were interviewed in 1988 and 1989 and followed until December 31, 2000, for all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used to analyze the association between five different levels of physical activity and all-cause mortality, after adjustment for gender, age, education, smoking habits, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and self-rated health. All analyses were conducted in 2003.
Results
For elderly people who were physically active occasionally, the risk of all-cause mortality was 28\% lower than for those who were physically inactive (hazard ratio [HR]=0.72; confidence interval [CI]=0.64–0.81), after adjustment for all explanatory variables. For those who were physically active once a week, the risk of all-cause mortality was 40\% lower than for those who were physically inactive (HR=0.60; CI=0.50–0.71). For those who were physically active more frequently, the reduction in all-cause mortality risk was about the same as for those who were physically active once a week. Diabetes, hypertension, and daily smoking were, as expected, significant risk factors for all-cause mortality.
Conclusions
Physical activity, even occasionally, decreases the risk of all-cause mortality among elderly people. Preventive resources among the elderly should include moderate exercise such as walking.},

	abstract = {Purpose We tried to clarify the trends in step-determined physical activity (PA) among Japanese adults from 1995 to 2016.
        Methods Raw data from the National Health and Nutrition Surveys Japan (NHNS-J) performed between 1995 and 2016 were used, in compliance with the Statistics Act of Japan. NHNS-J was conducted annually by the Japanese government (the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare) using a representative Japanese sample, with the same sampling method every year except in 2012 and 2016. A 1-d pedometer survey was conducted each year as a part of the NHNS-J, on a weekday in November specified by each individual. Because of the difference in age distribution of the samples, age-adjusted mean steps per day were calculated from 1995 to 2016 by sex. The time trends of step-determined PA levels among Japanese adults were described and examined using Joinpoint regression.
        Results The highest age-adjusted mean number of steps for men was 8235 steps per day in 2000, whereas it was 7667 steps per day in 2015. The highest age-adjusted mean numbers of steps for women were 7474 steps per day in 1998 and 6691 steps per day in 2015. The age-adjusted step-determined PA trend showed significantly decreasing trend from 1997 to 2008 in men (annual percentage change, −0.74; P {\textless} 0.001) and from 1998 to 2008 (annual percentage change, −1.30; P {\textless} 0.001) in women, by Joinpoint regression.
        Conclusion The age-adjusted step-determined PA among Japanese adults between 1995 and 2016 decreased from around 1997 to 1998 until around 2008, but since then, the decreasing trend became unclear both in men and in women. Continuous monitoring of PA trends is essential to assess the effectiveness of policies.},

	abstract = {Context
Epidemiologists and public health researchers are studying neighborhood's effect on individual health. The health of older adults may be more influenced by their neighborhoods as a result of decreased mobility. However, research on neighborhood's influence on older adults' health, specifically, is limited.
Evidence acquisition
Recent studies on neighborhood and health for older adults were identified. Studies were identified through searches of databases including PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, Academic Search Premier, Ageline, Social Science Citation Index, and Health Source. Criteria for inclusion were as follows: human studies; English language; study sample included adults aged ≥55 years; health outcomes, including mental health, health behaviors, morbidity, and mortality; neighborhood as the primary exposure variable of interest; empirical research; and studies that included ≥10 neighborhoods. Air pollution studies were excluded. Five hundred thirty-eight relevant articles were published during 1997–2007; a total of 33 of these articles met inclusion criteria.
Evidence synthesis
The measures of objective and perceived aspects of neighborhood were summarized. Neighborhood was primarily operationalized using census-defined boundaries. Measures of neighborhood were principally derived from objective sources of data; eight studies assessed perceived neighborhood alone or in combination with objective measures. Six categories of neighborhood characteristics were socioeconomic composition, racial composition, demographics, perceived resources and/or problems, physical environment, and social environment. The studies are primarily cross-sectional and use administrative data to characterize neighborhood.
Conclusions
These studies suggest that neighborhood environment is important for older adults' health and functioning.},

To evaluate income inequality within a community, the Gini coefficient within a 30-min walking distance from an individual’s residence was calculated using income distribution estimated by the National Census and the Housing and Land Survey 2013. Incidence of mood disorder was determined through insurance claims submitted from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2016. A multilevel logistic analysis with three levels—the individual, household, and residential district—was performed to evaluate the association.ResultsIncome inequality within a community at the neighborhood level was not associated with incidence of mood disorder in the models with and without equivalent household income (p for trend = 0.856 and 0.947, respectively). No difference was observed in the impact of the Gini coefficient among income levels, lower versus higher income groups (p for interaction between Gini coefficient and household income = 0.967). In contrast, lower equivalent income at the household level was significantly associated with higher incidence of mood disorder (p for trend {\textless} 0.001).ConclusionsWhile we confirmed that lower income at the household level itself had an adverse effect on mental health, income inequality within a community at the neighborhood level was not a significant factor for incidence of mood disorder in Japan.},

In addition, most previous studies have evaluated perception of neighborhood safety with questionnaires or field audits, both of which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study is the first attempt to measure perception of neighborhood safety using street view data and a machine learning approach. Four potential mediating pathways linking perception of neighborhood safety to mental health were explored for 1029 participants from 35 neighborhoods of Guangzhou, China. The results of multilevel regression models confirm that perception of neighborhood safety is positively associated with mental health. More importantly, physical activity, social cohesion, stress and life satisfaction mediate this relationship. The results of a moderation analysis suggest that the beneficial effects of physical activity and social cohesion on mental health are strengthened by a perception of neighborhood safety.

	abstract = {Objective
Loneliness and living alone have been strongly related to mental health but limited empirical evidence of these relationships exists among older people in Ghana. We examine the pathways of independent and interactive impacts of loneliness and living alone on psychological distress (PD) risk among older people in Ghana and to investigate whether the associations are moderated by neighborhood characteristics.
Methods
Data were analyzed for 1200 community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years from a 2016/2017 Aging, Health, Psychological Wellbeing and Health-seeking Behavior Study. Mental health and loneliness were respectively assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KPDS-10) and the Three-Item Loneliness Scale of the University of California, Los Angeles. OLS models estimated the associations and interactions.
Results
Participants were mostly women (63.3\% [95\%CI: 60.5–66.0\%]) with a mean age of 66.2 ± 11.9. Mean scores for PD and loneliness were 15.9 ± 4.7 and 5.3 ± 3.9 respectively whilst the prevalence of living alone was 38.2\% (95\%CI: 35.4–41.0\%). After full adjustment, the OLS regressions showed that loneliness (β = 1.474, SE = 0.151, p {\textless} 0.001), living alone (β = 0.381, SE = 0.162, p {\textless} 0.05) and the interaction between them (β = 0.917, SE = 0.308, p {\textless} 0.05) significantly increased the PD risk. However, engagement in regular physical activity, family contacts and social participation decreased PD outcomes among the socially isolated.
Limitation
The cross-sectional nature of the data may prohibit any causal and directional inferences.
Conclusions
Social connectedness and neighborhood engagements strongly buffer against the risk of later life mental disorders in the context of loneliness, and living alone. Moderate-to-rigorous physical activity and social cohesion should be effectively and strategically included in interventions targeted to improve older age mental health.},

	abstract = {Few longitudinal studies have explored to date whether minority status in disadvantaged neighborhoods conveys risk for negative mental health outcomes, and the mechanisms possibly leading to such risk. We investigated how minority status influences four developmental mental health outcomes in an ethnically homogeneous sample of Puerto Rican youth. We tested models of risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive and anxiety symptoms (DAS), and psychological distress, as Puerto Rican youth (aged 5-13 years) transitioned to early adulthood (15-29 years) in two sites, one where they grew up as a majority (the island of Puerto Rico), and another where they were part of a minority group (South Bronx, New York). At baseline, a stratified sample of 2,491 Puerto Rican youth participated from the two sites. After baseline assessment (Wave 1), each youth participant and one caregiver were assessed annually for two years, for a total of three time points (Waves 1-3). From April 2013 to August 2017, participants were contacted for a Wave 4 interview, and a total of 2,004 young people aged 15 to 29 years participated in the assessment (response rate adjusted for eligibility = 82.8\%). Using a quasi-experimental design, we assessed impacts of minority status on MDD, GAD, DAS and psychological distress. Via mediation analyses, we explored potential mechanisms underlying the observed relationships. Data from 1,863 Puerto Rican youth (after exclusion of those with MDD or GAD during Waves 1-3) indicated links between minority status and higher rates of lifetime and past-year GAD, DAS and past 30-day psychological distress at Wave 4, and a marginal trend for MDD, even after adjustments. Childhood social support and peer relationships partially explained the differences, as did intercultural conflict, neighborhood discrimination, and unfair treatment in young adulthood. The experience of growing up as a minority, as defined by context, seemingly elevates psychiatric risks, with differences in social relationships and increased social stress as mediators of this relationship. Our findings suggest that interventions at the neighborhood context rather than at the individual level might be important levers to reduce risks for the development of mood disorders in minority youth.},

Search terms included built environment, physical activity, exercise, walking, neighborhood, urban design, seniors, aging, aging in place, and physical environment.Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.The primary inclusion criterion included the relation between the built environment and the physical activity among seniors living in neighborhoods. Studies assessing physical activity or overall health of a community-based population were included if underlying theoretical models and concepts were applicable to a senior population. Studies solely assessing social or psychosocial characteristics of place were excluded, as were review articles.Data Extraction.Extracted data included theoretical model, aspect of built environment studied, methods, and outcomes.Data Synthesis.Tables present key definitions and summarize information from empirical studies.Results.Twenty-seven articles that focused on the environment-behavior relation in neighborhoods, six specific to seniors, were found. This area of research is in its infancy, and inconsistent findings reflect difficulties in measurement of the built environment.Conclusions.The relation between the built environment and the physical activity among seniors has been the subject of a limited number of studies. The choice of theoretical model drives the selection of concepts and variables considered. Safety, microscale urban design elements, aesthetics, and convenience of facilities are consistently studied across models. Few validated instruments have been developed and tested to measure neighborhood built environment.},

	abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study is to synthesise views and experiences of South Asian (SA) older adults in relation to exercise and physical activity (PA). It was anticipated that this work would identify barriers and facilitators that could inform interventions aimed at promoting PA among this population.
Method
A systematic review of qualitative research was conducted. Six electronic databases were searched for relevant papers published from January 2000 to October 2011. Studies were appraised and data extracted by two reviewers. A synthesis was undertaken using framework analysis. Of 26 papers read in full, 11 were included in the review.
Results
An overriding concept derived from the synthesis was the influence of empowering and disempowering contexts on PA levels of SA participants. It was supported by the following themes: communication (e.g. relying on relatives for translation of information, lack of understanding); relationships (e.g. social support from family, friends, community), beliefs (e.g. not culturally appropriate to exercise, fatalism) and environment (e.g. lack of accessible recreational areas/facilities).
Conclusions
Drawing on community resources to generate group norms appears to be important when trying to increase exercise and PA among SA older adults. Implications of the results for PA promotion and provision are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives
There are many studies concerning sarcopenia prevalence from all over the world. However, to our knowledge, only two compared urban and rural sarcopenia and to date, none have been conducted in the Americas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sarcopenia in a convenience sample of women ≥60 y of age who underwent bone densitometry and live in urban and rural areas of southern Brazil.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study comprising 205 women ≥60 y of age who had undergone bone densitometry. Sarcopenia was defined according to the criteria recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. The diagnosis combined the evaluation of muscle mass (assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscle strength (measured using a manual digital dynamometer), and muscular performance (evaluated by the 4-m walking speed test). Sociodemographic data, smoking status, chronic conditions, number of falls and fractures in the past year, and level of physical activity also were collected.
Results
Sarcopenia was present in 2.4\% of the total sample. Urban and rural populations significantly differed in terms of schooling (P {\textless} 0.001), occupation (P = 0.010), socioeconomic status (P = 0.001), and smoking status (P = 0.006). The environment in which the women lived was independently associated with sarcopenia (odds ratio, 9.561; 95\% confidence interval, 1.021–89.523; P = 0.048). The prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher in the urban women than in the rural group (5.7 versus 0.7\%, respectively; P = 0.047). After multivariate analysis, the environment of the women's residence remained independently associated with sarcopenia.
Conclusion
Urban elderly women are more vulnerable to sarcopenia than rural elderly women.},

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: A community-based environment. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 583 men and women aged 65 to 89 at baseline who were independent in both BADL and IADL. MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables regarding various factors potentially associated with functional decline were obtained from an interview survey and medical examinations at baseline. Dependent variables were functional status in BADL and IADL obtained at the time of the 3-year follow-up. RESULTS: During the 3-year follow-up, significant predictors for functional decline in BADL and only IADL decline included (1) age of ≥75, (2) less hand-grip strength, and (3) a history of hospitalization during the past 1 year. In addition, having poor intellectual activities and having poor social roles were identified as significant predictors for functional decline in only IADL during the 3-year follow-up. Furthermore, not having the habit of taking a walk was identified as a significant predictor of functional decline in BADL during the 3-year interval. CONCLUSION: Having a high level hand-grip strength, good intellectual activities, and good social roles are strongly associated with remaining independence in IADL for the nondisabled Japanese persons aged ≥65.},

Methods The present cross-sectional study carried out in 2010–2012 used data drawn from 509 community-dwelling older adults aged 65–86 years living in Kasama City, a Japanese rural region. We evaluated physical function with the following performance tests: grip strength, sit-to-stand, timed up \& go and walking speed. Using geographic information systems, we measured population density and the number of destinations related to daily life, community centers, medical facilities and recreational facilities within participants’ neighborhoods. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, we found lower population density was related to poor performance of sit-to-stand and walking speed in both sexes, and grip strength in women (trend P {\textless} 0.05). A lower number of daily life-related destinations was related to poor performance of sit-to-stand and walking speed in men, and grip strength and sit-to-stand in women. Similarly, the number of community centers was related to walking speed in both sexes. The number of medical and recreational facilities was also related to some physical performance in both sexes. A lower land use mix score, calculated by principal component analysis, was related to lower performance of sit-to-stand and walking speed in men, and grip strength and sit-to-stand in women. Conclusion The present study suggests that, although there are some sex differences, low population density, land use mix, and fewer daily life-related destinations, community centers, medical facilities and recreational facilities are negative determinants of physical function.

The association with physical functioning and its decline at older age remains to be explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate the longitudinal association between the natural environment and the decline in physical functioning in older adults. We based our analyses on three follow-ups (2002−2013) of the Whitehall II study, including 5759 participants (aged 50 to 74 years at baseline) in the UK. Exposure to natural environments was assessed at each follow-up as (1) residential surrounding greenness across buffers of 500 and 1000 m around the participants' address using satellite-based indices of greenness (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and (2) the distance from home to the nearest natural environment, separately for green and blue spaces, using a land cover map. Physical functioning was characterized by walking speed, measured three times, and grip strength, measured twice. Linear mixed effects models were used to quantify the impact of green and blue space on physical functioning trajectories, controlled for relevant covariates. We found higher residential surrounding greenness (EVI and NDVI) to be associated with slower 10-year decline in walking speed. Furthermore, proximity to natural environments (green and blue spaces combined) was associated with slower decline in walking speed and grip strength. We observed stronger associations between distance to natural environments and decline in physical functioning in areas with higher compared to lower area-level deprivation. However, no association was observed with distance to green or blue spaces separately. The associations with decline in physical functioning were partially mediated by social functioning and mental health. Our results suggest that higher residential surrounding greenness and living closer to natural environments contribute to better physical functioning at older ages.},

	abstract = {Background: Studies have shown that rural residents face disadvantages concerning medical access and socio-economic conditions. However, the social determinants of health among older people in rural areas are still unclear. The Neuron to Environmental Impact across Generations (NEIGE) study investigated the social determinants of health among older rural adults.Methods: A survey was conducted among the older residents of Tokamachi City, Japan. We randomly selected study participants (N = 1,346) from four stratified groups by age (65–74 and 75–84 years) and residential area (Tokamachi center [downtown] and Matsunoyama [mountain]). The survey collected data on socio-economic status, lifestyle, health, and neighborhood environment. Blood and urine sampling were also conducted, and physical activity was assessed. Magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI) and Apo-E gene were also examined in the analysis.Results: In total, 527 people participated in the NEIGE study (participation rate: 39.2\%). The average age of the participants was 73.5 (standard deviation, 5.6) years, and 47.3\% were male. No differences in demographics were found between downtown and mountain residents, except for educational attainment, which was lower among mountain residents. Lifestyles were similar, except for the higher percentage of everyday drinkers (33.3–35.3\%) in the mountain area. Concerning physical health, muscle mass, grip strength, and measured physical activity were significantly higher among mountain residents. However, gait speed and balance were better among downtown residents.Conclusion: The findings of the NEIGE study will help elucidate the social determinants of health in older rural adults in Japan, and emphasize the different outcomes between downtown and mountain areas.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Findings from observational studies of relations between neighborhood environments and health outcomes underscore the importance of both objective and perceived experiences of those environments. A clearer understanding of the factors associated with discrepancies between these two assessment approaches is needed to tailor public health interventions to specific populations. This study examined how individual and neighborhood characteristics affect perceptions of supermarket distance, particularly when perceptions do not match objective measures. (2) Methods: Participants were older adults (n = 880) participating in the Senior Neighborhood Quality of Life Study in the Seattle/King County, WA or Baltimore/Washington, DC regions. Two main analyses were conducted. The primary outcome for Analysis I was participants\&rsquo; geographic information systems (GIS)-based objective network distance to the closest supermarket. Generalized linear mixed models with block group-level random effects were used to assess associations between objective supermarket distance and individual/neighborhood characteristics. The primary outcome for Analysis II was a categorical \&ldquo;accuracy\&rdquo; variable, based on participants\&rsquo; perceived distance to the nearest supermarket/grocery store relative to the objective distance, assuming a walking speed of 1.0 m/s. Multivariate log-linear models fit neural networks were used to assess influential covariates. (3) Results: Several significant associations with objective distance to the nearest supermarket were observed, including a negative relationship with body mass index (BMI) (95\% CI = \&minus;45.56, \&minus;0.23), having walked to the supermarket in the last 30 days (\&minus;174.86, \&minus;59.42), living in a high-walkability neighborhood, and residing in Seattle/King County (\&minus;707.69, \&minus;353.22). In terms of participants\&rsquo; distance accuracy, 29\% were classified as accurate, 33.9\% were \&ldquo;Underestimators\&rdquo;, 24.0\% \&ldquo;Overestimators\&rdquo;, and 13.2\% responded \&ldquo;Don\&rsquo;t Know\&rdquo;. Compared to Accurate participants, Overestimators were significantly less likely to have walked to the supermarket in the last 30 days, and lived objectively closer to a supermarket; Underestimators perceived significantly higher pedestrian safety and lived objectively further from a supermarket; and Don\&rsquo;t Know were more likely to be women, older, not living independently, and not having recently walked to the supermarket. (4) Conclusions: Both modifiable and nonmodifiable factors influence the accuracy of older adults\&rsquo; perceptions of their proximity to the nearest supermarket. Recent experience in walking to the closest supermarket, along with personal safety, represent potentially modifiable perceived environmental factors that were related to older adults\&rsquo; accuracy of perceptions of their neighborhood food environment.},

	abstract = {Neighborhood environment is consistently associated with obesity; changes to modifiable aspects of the neighborhood environment may curb the growth of obesity in the US and other developed nations. However, currently the majority of studies are cross-sectional and thus not appropriate for evaluating causality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a neighborhood-changing intervention on changes in obesity among older women. Over the past 30 years the Portland, Oregon metropolitan region has made significant investments in plans, regulatory structures, and public facilities to reduce sprawl and increase compact growth centers, transit-oriented development approaches, and green space. We used geocoded residential addresses to link data on land-use mix, public transit access, street connectivity, and access to green space from four time points between 1986 and 2004, with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) from a cohort of 2003 community-dwelling women aged 66 years and older. Height and weight were measured at clinic visits. Women self-reported demographics, health habits, and chronic conditions, and self-rated their health. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was assessed from census data. Neighborhood walkability and access to green space improved over the 18-year study period. On average there was a non-significant mean weight loss in the cohort between baseline (mean age 72.6 years) and the study's end (mean age 85.0 years). We observed no association between neighborhood built environment or change in built environment and BMI. Greater neighborhood socioeconomic status at baseline was independently associated with a healthier BMI at baseline, and protected against an age-related decline in BMI over time. BMI decreases with age reflect increased frailty, especially among older adults with complex morbidities. Future research should consider the influence of the neighborhood environment on additional relevant health outcomes and should include measures of the social environment in conjunction with built environment measures.},

	abstract = {Objective
Previous studies exploring the relationship of neighborhood characteristics with metabolic conditions have focused on middle-aged adults but none have comprehensively investigated associations in older adults, a potentially vulnerable population. The aim was to explore the relationship of neighborhood characteristics with metabolic conditions in older women.

Design
Cross-sectional analysis.

Setting/Participants
We studied 384 women aged 70–79 years, representing the two-thirds least disabled women in the community, enrolled in the Women’s Health and Aging Study II at baseline. Neighborhood scores were calculated from census-derived data on median household income, median house value, percent earning interest income, percent completing high school, percent completing college, and percent with managerial or executive occupation. Participants were categorized by quartile of neighborhood score with a higher quartile representing relative neighborhood advantage. Logistic regression models were created to assess the association of neighborhood quartiles to outcomes, adjusting for key covariates.

Measurements
Primary outcomes included metabolic conditions: obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Secondary outcomes included BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure and lipids.

Results
Higher neighborhood quartile score was associated with a lower prevalence of obesity (highest quartile=13.5\% versus lowest quartile=36.5\%; p{\textless}0.001 for trend). A lower prevalence of diabetes was also observed in highest (6.3\%) versus lowest (14.4\%) neighborhood quartiles, but was not significantly different (p= 0.24 for trend). Highest versus lowest neighborhood quartile was associated with lower HbA1c (−0.31\%, p=0.02) in unadjusted models. Women in the highest versus lowest neighborhood quartile had lower BMI (−2.01 kg/m2, p=0.001) and higher HDL-cholesterol (+6.09 mg/dL, p=0.01) after accounting for age, race, inflammation, and smoking.

Conclusion
Worse neighborhood characteristics are associated with adiposity, hyperglycemia, and low HDL. Further longitudinal studies are needed and can inform future interventions to improve metabolic status in older adults.},

	abstract = {Socioeconomic resources, such as education, prevent disability but are not readily modifiable. We tested the hypothesis that household and neighborhood conditions, which may be modifiable, partially account for associations between education and physical capacity in a population-based sample of older adults. The National Health and Aging Trends Study measured education ({\textless}high school, high school, some college, and ≥Bachelor's), household and neighborhood conditions, using a 16-item environmental checklist and a 3-item social cohesion scale, and physical capacity with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), grip strength and peak expiratory flow. Structural equation models were used to decompose total educational effects into direct effects and indirect effects via household and neighborhood conditions, using sample weights and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, household size, BMI, self-reported health, and number of medical conditions in 6874 community-dwelling participants. Education was directly associated with SPPB scores (β = 0.055, p {\textless} 0.05) and peak flow (β = 0.095, p {\textless} 0.05), but not grip strength. Also, indirect effects were found for household disorder with SPPB scores (β = 0.013, p {\textless} 0.05), grip strength (β = 0.007, p {\textless} 0.05), and peak flow (β = 0.010, p {\textless} 0.05). Indirect effects were also found for street disorder with SPPB scores (β = 0.012, p {\textless} 0.05). Indirect effects of household and neighborhood conditions accounted for approximately 35\%, 27\% and 14\% of the total association between education and SPPB scores, grip strength level, and peak expiratory flow level, respectively. Household disorder and street disorder partially accounted for educational disparities in physical capacity. However, educational disparities in SPPB scores and peak expiratory flow persisted after accounting for household and neighborhood conditions and chronic conditions, suggesting additional pathways. Interventions and policies aiming to support aging in place should consider addressing household-level and street-level disorder.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Little research to date has explored typologies of physical activity among older adults. An understanding of physical activity patterns may help to both determine the health benefits of different types of activity and target interventions to increase activity levels in older adults. This analysis, conducted in 2014, used a latent class analysis approach to characterize patterns of physical activity in a cohort of older adults.
Methods
A total of 3,497 men and women aged 65–75 years living in New York City completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) in 2011. PASE scale items were used to classify subjects into latent classes. Multinomial regression was then used to relate individual and neighborhood characteristics to class membership.
Results
Five latent classes were identified: “least active,” “walkers,” “domestic/gardening,” “athletic,” and “domestic/gardening athletic.” Individual-level predictors, including more education, higher income, and better self-reported health, were associated with membership in the more-active classes, particularly the athletic classes. Residential characteristics, including living in single-family housing and living in the lower-density boroughs of New York City, were predictive of membership in one of the domestic/gardening classes. Class membership was associated with BMI even after controlling for total PASE score.
Conclusions
This study suggests that individual and neighborhood characteristics are associated with distinct physical activity patterns in a group of older urban adults. These patterns are associated with body habitus independent of overall activity.},

Regression analyses examined the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and environmental infrastructure features, adjusting for demographics and lower body function. Results: Older adults who perceived their neighborhood as less safe from crime and had reduced access to services were more likely to have higher BMI. Controlling for demographic and functional characteristics, access to services remained significant. This association remained significant for those with lower functional status. Discussion: This research suggests that neighborhood environment may have an influence on BMI above and beyond walking activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suburban development patterns may impede physical activity (PA) and mobility and affect healthy aging. This paper investigates the relationships between neighborhood design and walking, driving, PA, and obesity in adults over age 65 years.
METHODS: Data from the SMARTRAQ (Atlanta region) survey provided measures of PA, BMI, SES, and travel patterns. Neighborhood design was measured using a walkability index (residential density, street connectivity, retail density, and land use mix). Chi square and regression was used to evaluate relationships.
RESULTS: Increased walkability was related with more walking (OR 2.02), less time spent traveling in a car (OR .53), and lower odds of being overweight (OR .68). Those with 1 or no cars were more likely to walk (OR 2.9) and spend less time in cars (OR .53); but also less likely to get recommended levels of PA (OR .55). Visiting a fast food outlet was associated with increased odds of obesity (OR 1.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Policies are needed to bring older Americans closer to shops and services and healthy food outlets as a means of encouraging regular walking and healthy body weight. Incentives to encourage neighborhood grocery stores and affordable housing in central areas along with regulatory reform through zoning can encourage PA and healthy body weight in the elderly.},

	abstract = {We expand the search for modifiable features of neighborhood environments that alter obesity risk in two ways. First, we examine residents' access to neighborhood retail food options in combination with neighborhood features that facilitate physical activity. Second, we evaluate neighborhood features for both low income and non-low income neighborhoods (bottom quartile of median neighborhood income versus the top three quartiles). Our analyses use data from the Utah Population Database merged with U.S. Census data and Dun \& Bradstreet business data for Salt Lake County, Utah. Linear regressions for BMI and logistic regressions for the likelihood of being obese are estimated using various measures of the individual's neighborhood food options and walkability features. As expected, walkability indicators of older neighborhoods and neighborhoods where a higher fraction of the population walks to work is related to a lower BMI/obesity risk, although the strength of the effects varies by neighborhood income. Surprisingly, the walkability indicator of neighborhoods with higher intersection density was linked to higher BMI/obesity risk. The expected inverse relationship between the walkability indicator of population density and BMI/obesity risk is found only in low income neighborhoods. We find a strong association between neighborhood retail food options and BMI/obesity risk with the magnitude of the effects again varying by neighborhood income. For individuals living in non-low income neighborhoods, having one or more convenience stores, full-service restaurants, or fast food restaurants is associated with reduced BMI/obesity risk, compared to having no neighborhood food outlets. The presence of at least one healthy grocery option in low income neighborhoods is also associated with a reduction in BMI/obesity risk relative to no food outlets. Finally, multiple food options within a neighborhood reduce BMI/obesity risk, relative to no food options, for individuals living in either low-income or non-low neighborhoods.},

	abstract = {Background
Obesity has reached epidemic proportions. Although its causes are not well understood, its increasing prevalence is not likely to be due to genetic factors or underlying biology. This has led to interest in the role of environmental factors, although few studies have focused on the role of the social environment. This study investigated whether neighborhood psychosocial hazards independent of individual risk factors were associated with increased odds of obesity.
Methods
Baseline data were analyzed in 2005 from a cohort study of 1140 randomly selected community-dwelling men and women aged 50 to 70 years from 65 contiguous neighborhoods in Baltimore MD. Body mass index (BMI in kilograms/meters squared) was calculated from measured height and weight at baseline (2001–2002). People with a BMI of 30 and higher were considered obese. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine associations between a 12-item scale of neighborhood psychosocial hazards and the odds of obesity.
Results
Thirty-eight percent of the cohort were obese. Residents of neighborhoods in the highest quartile of the Neighborhood Psychosocial Hazards scale were nearly twice as likely to be obese compared to residents in the least-hazardous neighborhoods (53\% vs 27\%). After adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, household wealth, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, self-reported physical activity, and dietary intake, living in more hazardous neighborhoods was associated with a graded increase in the odds of obesity. This association was partially mediated by physical activity.
Conclusions
Even after controlling for a large set of demographic, behavioral, and socioeconomic individual-level risk factors, living in a neighborhood with greater psychosocial hazards was independently associated with obesity.},

	abstract = {Objective: Increasing evidence suggests a reverse J-shaped association between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality among the older population. However, findings from non-Western societies including Japan are still sparse. Furthermore, little evidence regarding variation by age and gender in the BMI-mortality relationship in old age exists. This study aimed to examine age and gender variations in the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality among older Japanese.Design: Data came from a national representative sample of community-dwelling Japanese aged 60 years and older at baseline (n = 4,869). Participants were followed for up to 25 years. We categorized BMI into seven categories: {\textless} 18.5, 18.5–19.9, 20.0–21.4, 21.5–22.9, 23.0–24.9, 25.0–26.9, and ≥ 27.0. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relative mortality risk associated with BMI categories.Results: Lower BMI ({\textless} 18.5 and 18.5–19.9) was associated with higher mortality, compared to the mid-normal weight category (BMI: 21.5–22.9), after adjusting for covariates. In contrast, high-normal weight (BMI: 23.0–24.9) and overweight (BMI: 25.0–26.9 and ≥ 27.0) were not associated with mortality. Relative to old-old (aged ≥ 75 years), the higher mortality risk associated with lower BMI ({\textless} 20) appeared to be more prominent among young-old (aged 60–74 years). A moderately increased mortality risk associated with low BMI (18.5–19.9) was identified among men but not among women.Conclusion: Among older Japanese, low BMI ({\textless} 20.0) was associated with higher mortality, while high BMI (≥ 27.0) was not. The increased mortality risk associated with low BMI is more apparent among young-old and men. These age and gender differences need to be considered in assessing healthy body weight in old age.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Neighborhood environments may play a role in the rising prevalence of obesity among older adults. However, research on built environmental correlates of obesity in this age group is limited. The current study aimed to explore associations of Walk Score, a validated measure of neighborhood walkability, with BMI and waist circumference in a large, diverse sample of older women.
Methods
This study linked cross-sectional data on 6,526 older postmenopausal women from the Women’s Health Initiative Long Life Study (2012–2013) to Walk Scores for each participant’s address (collected in 2012). Linear and logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of BMI and waist circumference with continuous and categorical Walk Score measures. Secondary analyses examined whether these relationships could be explained by walking expenditure or total physical activity. All analyses were conducted in 2015.
Results
Higher Walk Score was not associated with BMI or overall obesity after adjustment for sociodemographic, medical, and lifestyle factors. However, participants in highly walkable areas had significantly lower odds of abdominal obesity (waist circumference {\textgreater}88 cm) as compared with those in less walkable locations. Observed associations between walkability and adiposity were partly explained by walking expenditure.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that neighborhood walkability is linked to abdominal adiposity, as measured by waist circumference, among older women and provide support for future longitudinal research on associations between Walk Score and adiposity in this population.},

Both excessive weight gain and weight loss are important risk factors in the older population. Neighborhood environment may play an important role in weight change, but neighborhood effects on weight gain and weight loss have not been studied separately. This study examined the associations between neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and excessive weight gain and weight loss.
Methods
This analysis included 153,690 men and 105,179 women (aged 51–70 years). Baseline addresses were geocoded into geographic coordinates and linked to the 2000 U.S. Census at the Census tract level. Census variables were used to generate a socioeconomic deprivation index by principle component analysis. Excessive weight gain and loss were defined as gaining or losing {\textgreater}10\% of baseline (1995–1996) body weight at follow-up (2004–2006). The analysis was performed in 2015.
Results
More severe neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation was associated with higher risks of both excessive weight gain and weight loss after adjusting for individual indicators of SES, disease conditions, and lifestyle factors (Quintile 5 vs Quintile 1: weight gain, OR=1.36, 95\% CI=1.28, 1.45 for men and OR=1.20, 95\% CI=1.13, 1.27 for women; weight loss, OR=1.09, 95\%\% CI=1.02, 1.17 for men and OR=1.23, 95\% CI=1.14, 1.32 for women). The findings were fairly consistent across subpopulations with different demographics and lifestyle factors.
Conclusions
Neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation predicts higher risk of excessive weight gain and weight loss.},

However, little is known regarding the relation between access to restaurant and obesity among the Chinese population. This study aims to explore the relationship between neighbourhood restaurant density and body mass index (BMI) in rural China.
Design A longitudinal study using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) was conducted. Participants aged 18 and older from the 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011 CHNS were recruited Separate sex-stratified random intercept-slope growth models of repeated BMI observations were estimated in the study.
Setting The data were derived from rural communities in nine provinces in China.
Participants There were 11 835 male and 12 561 female person-years assessed in this study.
Outcomes The primary outcome of this study was weight status. It is defined as a BMI value, a continuous variable which is calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height (m2).
Results The study indicated that among men an increase of one indoor restaurant in the neighbourhood was associated with a 0.01 kg/m2 increase in BMI, and an increase of one fixed outdoor food stall was associated with a 0.01 kg/m2 decrease in BMI, whereas among women, an increase of one indoor restaurant in the neighbourhood was associated with a 0.005 kg/m2 increase in BMI, and an increase of one fast-food restaurant and one fixed outdoor food stall was associated with a 0.02 and 0.004 kg/m2 decline in BMI, respectively.
Conclusions The density of neighbourhood restaurants was found to be significantly related to BMI in rural China. The results indicated that providing healthy food choices and developing related public health policies are necessary to tackle obesity among rural Chinese adults.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To investigate whether walking mediates neighborhood built environment associations with weight status in middle- and older-aged women.
Methods
Participants (N=5085; mean age=64±7.7; 75.4\% White non-Hispanic) were from the Women’s Health Initiative San Diego cohort baseline visits. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured objectively. Walking was assessed via survey. The geographic information system (GIS)-based home neighborhood activity supportiveness index included residential density, street connectivity, land use mix, and number of parks.
Results
BMI was 0.22 units higher and the odds ratio for being obese (vs. normal or overweight) was 8\% higher for every standard deviation decrease in neighborhood activity supportiveness. Walking partially mediated these associations (22–23\% attenuation). Findings were less robust for waist circumference.
Conclusions
Findings suggest women who lived in activity-supportive neighborhoods had a lower BMI than their counterparts, in part because they walked more. Improving neighborhood activity supportiveness has population-level implications for improving weight status and health.},

	abstract = {Background The aim of this study was to describe the age-dependent changes in the parameters of physical performance and body composition in Japanese older adults who are independently dwelling in the community. We also examined whether the age-dependent changes differ among physical performance and body composition parameters. Methods Cross-sectional data from 10 092 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 73.6 years; 5296 women) were analyzed. The measures of physical performance included hand-grip strength, the five-times-sit-to-stand test, and walking speed. Body composition parameters (body weight, fat mass, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass) were measured with a bioelectrical impedance analyser. Correlations between age and the physical performance and body composition parameters were tested. The T-scores of physical performance and body composition measurements were calculated and presented according to 5-year age groups to examine the differences in age-dependent changes in physical performance and body composition parameters. Results All physical performance measures significantly decreased with aging. The cumulative mean T-scores according to age group showed different age-dependent changes between body mass index (BMI) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) (cumulative mean T-score change of BMI and ASMI of −5.7 to −2.9 and −12.7 to −12.1, respectively). The slope declines in age-associated changes were greater in grip strength (β = −0.77, 95\% confidence interval = −0.82 to −0.76) for men and in walking speed (β = −0.95, 95\% confidence interval = −0.99 to −0.90) for women. Conclusions The patterns of age-dependent decreases in physical performance measures differed among parameters and between sexes. There is a possibility of a difference in the age-related slope patterns among parameters; decreases in grip strength in men and walking speed in women may be more prominent with advancing age. Furthermore, the decrease in ASMI with age is more striking than that of BMI.},

We derived patterns of geographic information systems- (GIS) measured BE features and explored how they accounted for differences in objective and self-reported PA, sedentary time, and BMI in a sample of older adults. Senior Neighborhood Quality of Life Study participants (N=714, aged 66–97years, 52.1\% women, 29.7\% racial/ethnic minority) were sampled in 2005–2008 from the Seattle-King County, WA and Baltimore, MD-Washington, DC regions. Participants' home addresses were geocoded, and net residential density, land use mix, retail floor area ratio, intersection density, public transit density, and public park and private recreation facility density measures for 1-km network buffers were derived. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) were estimated from these GIS-based measures. In multilevel regression models, profiles were compared on accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time and self-reported PA, adjusting for covariates and clustering. Analyses were conducted in 2014–2015. LPAs yielded three profiles: low walkability/transit/recreation (L−L−L); mean walkability/transit/recreation (M-M-M); and high walkability/transit/recreation (H−H−H). Three PA outcomes were more favorable in the HHH than the LLL profile group (difference of 7.2min/day for MVPA, 97.8min/week for walking for errands, and 79.2min/week for walking for exercise; all ps{\textless}0.02). The most and least activity-supportive BE profiles showed greater differences in older adults' PA than did groupings based solely on a 4-component walkability index, suggesting that diverse BE features are important for healthy aging.},

Physical activity, sedentary behavior, and BMI were measured objectively.Analysis:The relationships of walkable urban design attributes, Walk Score?, and BMI were examined by multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates in all models. Mediation effects of the physical activity and sedentary behavior variables in these relationships were tested using a product-of-coefficients test.Results:Higher population density and Walk Score? were associated with lower BMI. Light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activities partially mediated the relationships between these walkable urban design attributes and BMI.Conclusions:Developing active-friendly environmental policies to (re)design neighborhoods may not only promote active transport behaviors but also help in improving residents? health status in non-Western contexts.},

	abstract = {Background. Knowledge pertaining to the relationship between migration status and psychosocial job characteristics and long-term illness is not readily available in the international literature. The aim of this study is to analyse the cross-sectional associations between high psychological job demands and low decision latitude (high job strain), work-related social support and long-term illness among foreign-born and Swedish-born people. Methods. The present study combines four annual simple random samples covering 1994–97 from the Swedish Annual Level of Living Survey (SALLS). A sub-sample, including only employed persons and consisting of 10,072 Swedish-born persons, 710 labour migrants and 333 refugees aged 25–64 years, was analysed using logistic regression. Results. Refugees had a higher risk (OR=1.33; 95\% CI: 1.05–1.69) of long-term illness than Swedes. Moreover, those experiencing both high job demands and a low decision latitude ran an increased risk (OR=1.74; 95\% CI: 1.42–2.13) of long-term illness. About 63\% of the refugees among the unskilled/skilled manual workers had low decision latitudes in comparison with 17\% of the intermediate and senior salaried employees. There were only small differences in job demands between labour immigrants, refugees and Swedes. There was no interaction between migration status and high job strain. However, refugees with low social support had nearly twice as high a risk of long-term illness as Swedes with high-level work-related social support. Conclusions. Refugees ran a higher risk of long-term illness than Swedes. Although there were no differences in risk between labour immigrants, refugees and Swedes under job strain, refugees with low work-related social support had a high risk of long-term illness. Unskilled/skilled refugee workers had lower decision latitudes than Swedes.},

To study whether symptoms of self-reported anxiety, sleeping problems and severe pain are more common among Turkish-born immigrants in Sweden than among Swedes, and whether age and socio-economic status can explain this hypothesised difference. Design. Two random samples were studied—the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare Immigrant Survey, and the Swedish Annual Level-of-Living Survey, both from 1996. A total of 526 Turkish-born immigrants in Sweden were compared with 2,854 Swedish controls, all aged between 27 and 60 years. Data were analysed by sex, in an age-adjusted model; and a full model also included age, education, marital status, employment and country of origin (logistic regression). Results. In the full model, odds ratios were 2.12 (1.43–3.15) for anxiety, 2.60 (1.82–3.72) for sleeping problems, and 2.14 (1.50–3.05) for severe pain among Turkish-born men, and 2.44 (1.69–3.53) for anxiety, 3.01 (2.09–4.33) for sleeping problems, and 2.59 (1.80–3.71) for severe pain among Turkish-born women, using the Swedish controls as references. Conclusions. Being a Turkish-born immigrant in Sweden significantly increases the risks for self-reported anxiety, sleeping problems and severe pain, even after adjusting for age and socio-economic status (education, marital status and employment).},

Results: For Finnish women living in Sweden the odds of self-rated poor health was significantly higher (OR=1.25, 95\% CI=1.02—1.54) than for Finnish women living in Finland. An opposite pattern appeared among men; Finnish men living in Finland tended to have higher odds of self-rated poor health than Finnish men living in Sweden, although not to a statistically significant extent. In addition, Finns in Finland and in Sweden rated their health poorer than Swedes. Conclusions: Migration may have a different effect on Finnish men's and women's self-rated health.

	abstract = {Objective. Increasing global migration has led to profound demographic changes in most industrialised countries. A growing body of research has investigated various health aspects among immigrant groups and found that some immigrant groups have poorer health than the majority population. It has been suggested that poor acculturation in the host country could lie behind the increased risk of worsened health among certain immigrant groups. The aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association between acculturation, measured as age at migration or length of residence, and self-rated health among young immigrants. Design. The simple, random samples of 7137 women and 7415 men aged 16–34 years were based on pooled, independent data collected during the period 1992–1999 obtained from the Swedish Annual Level of Living Survey (SALLS). Logistic regression was applied in the estimation of odds ratios (OR) for poor self-rated health, after accounting for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES) and social networks. The non-response rate varied between 23.6 and 28.3\% in the different immigrant groups. Results. The odds of poor self-rated health increased with increasing age at migration to Sweden among first-generation immigrants. For those who had resided in Sweden less than 15 years the odds of poor self-rated health were significantly increased. In addition, most of the immigrant groups had higher odds of poor self-rated health than the reference group. Conclusions. Health care workers and policy makers need to be aware that immigrants who arrive in the host country at higher ages and/or have lived in the host country for a shorter period of time might need special attention as they are more likely to suffer from poor self-rated health, a valid health status indicator that can be used in population health monitoring.},

DESIGN--The study used data obtained from ongoing surveys of living conditions conducted by Statistics Sweden using annual interviews of cohorts of about 8000 people. SETTING--The study was a population based survey of the whole of Sweden. PARTICIPANTS--The analysis involved a group of 25,586 respondents (males 12,812, females 12,774), aged 25-74 years, interviewed in 1977 and 1979-81. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS--Mortality and occupational health selection were analysed in different occupational categories. The association between mortality and self reported morbidity was assessed. Level of physical strain at work was associated with mortality in men. Occupational health selection could be detected for men but not for women when mortality from all causes was investigated. Self assessment of health predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS--Subjective assessments of health through surveys are valuable as predictors of mortality for both men and women.},

	abstract = {In a series of articles from the Stockholm Spinal Cord Injury Study (SSCIS), the health status of a near-total regional SCI population comprising 353 subjects has been investigated. The present study describes the psycho-social and financial consequences of SCI in this group. It is based on a level-of-living survey that has been used annually on 8000-14,000 Swedes since 1974. The health-focused version of this survey was used for data collection in the subset of 326 subjects in the SSCIS that were residents of the Greater Stockholm area. The normative material consisted of 1978 interviews of residents of the same area, provided by the Swedish Bureau of Statistics. The results show that SCI subjects, although provided with basic material commodities up to par with the general population, have less financial reserves and more frequently express worry about their finances. Less than half of the subjects are gainfully employed, when part-time jobs are also included. Social activities are more restricted, and more centered on the core social network. Several items in the survey point to a preoccupation with personal rather than public matters. We feel that these factors, at least to some degree, are consequential to separation from the workplace, with resulting disadvantageous financial and social effects. Intensified vocational rehabilitation efforts might thus be justified from both an economic and a psycho-social point of view.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyse both cross-sectional associations and how longitudinal changes in lifestyle factors from one state in 1980-1981 to another in 1988-1989 influence self-reported health status. Another aim was to estimate the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for the changes in lifestyle factors and self-reported hypertension during the same period of time.
METHOD: The cross-sectional and the longitudinal analyses are based on the same simple random sample of 3,843 adults, aged 25-74, interviewed in 1980-1981 and 1988-1989 and is part of the Swedish Annual Level-of-Living Survey. About 85\% of the respondents in the first interview participated in a second interview in 1988-1989. Cross-sectional odds ratios, based on a marginal model, were estimated using the generalized estimating equations. The transitional models were analysed using unconditional logistic regression. A proportional hazard model was applied to investigate the influence of lifestyle transitions on mortality.
RESULTS: Physical inactivity, being a current or former smoker and obesity (women only) were strong risk factors for poor health either as main effects and/or combined (interactions). There was a strong interaction between physical activity and smoking, and for women, also between body mass index (BMI) and physical activity. Smoking, physically inactive and obese women had about a ten times higher risk of poor health status than non-smoking, physically active, and normal-weight women. The corresponding risk for men was about five times higher. Physically active, but smoking and obese individuals showed only moderately increased risks for poor health status. The transitional model showed that those who were physically inactive in 1980-1981, but did exercise in 1988-1989, improved their health after adjustments for sociodemographic and other lifestyle factors. Continuing to smoke or being physically inactive or having hypertension at both points in time were all associated with higher hazard ratios for all-cause mortality (1.6, 1.9 and 1.8, respectively) than those who reported that they were in good status at both points in time.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that physical activity protects against poor health irrespective of an increased BMI and smoking. The major clinical implications are the long-standing benefits of physical activity and not smoking.},

METHODS: A random sample of 9240 persons aged 25 to 74 years were interviewed during 1988 and 1989. The socioeconomic environment of each respondent's neighborhood was measured with the Care Need Index (CNI) and the Townsend score. The data were analyzed with a multilevel model adjusted for the independent variables. The second-level variables were the 2 neighborhood scores. RESULTS: There was a clear gradient for poor health and education within every CNI interval so that with an increasing CNI (indicating more deprivation), the prevalence of poor health increased in all 3 education groups (P = .001). In the full model, decreasing educational level, obesity, length and frequency of smoking, physical inactivity, and increasing CNI were associated with poor health. Persons living in the most deprived neighborhoods had a prevalence ratio of 1.69 (95\% confidence interval = 1.44, 1.98) for poor health compared with those living in the most affluent areas.

This study used the theoretical frameworks of the Chicago school and the Stirling County group in order to analyze the impact of neighborhood violent crime and neighborhood unemployment on CHD in an urban setting, the capital of Sweden. The entire population of Stockholm County aged 35–64 years on January 1, 1998 was included in the study. All individuals were followed for CHD until December 31, 1998. Small area neighborhood units were used to define neighborhoods. The neighborhood-level variables were calculated as rates of violent crime or unemployment in the small area neighborhood units, categorized in quintiles. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and neighborhood-level variance in three different models. When rates of neighborhood violent crime or neighborhood unemployment increased, the risk of CHD increased among both women and men. In neighborhoods with the highest rates of violent crime (quintile 5), the odds ratios were 1.75 (CI=1.37–2.22) and 1.39 (CI=1.19–1.63) for women and men, respectively. In neighborhoods with the highest unemployment rates, the corresponding odds ratios were 2.05 (CI=1.62–2.59) and 1.50 (CI=1.28–1.75). These average neighborhood effects on CHD (fixed effects) remained almost unaltered after inclusion of the individual-level variables. The neighborhood-level variance indicated significant differences in CHD between neighborhoods, and the neighborhood-level and individual-level variables partly explained the variance between neighborhoods (random effects). Public safety and social stability in socially disorganized neighborhoods need to be improved in order to promote cardiovascular health.},

We investigated (i) whether women living in the same neighborhood have a similar propensity for disability pension that relates to neighborhood social participation, and (ii) whether there is an association between anxiolytic-hypnotic drug (AHD) use and disability pension in women that is modified by the neighborhood context. Methods: We used multilevel logistic regression with 12,156 women aged 45 to 64 (first level) residing in 95 neighborhoods (second level) in the city of Malmö (250,000 inhabitants), Sweden, who participated in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (1991—96). Results: Both AHD use (OR=2.09, 95\% CI 1.65, 2.65) and neighborhood rate of low social participation (OR=11.85, 95\% CI 5.09, 27.58) were associated with higher propensity for disability pension. The interval odds ratio indicated that the influence of neighborhood social participation was large compared with the unexplained variance between the neighborhoods. The association between AHD use and disability pension was not modified by the neighborhood context. The median odds ratio was 1.44 after adjusting for individual characteristics and 1.27 after the additional adjusting for neighborhood social participation. Conclusions: Women living in the same neighborhood appear to have a similar propensity for disability pension, beyond individual characteristics, and this contextual effect seems largely explained by neighborhood social participation. In addition, AHD use might increase the propensity for disability pension in women.},

	abstract = {Background
Research has not firmly established whether living in a deprived neighborhood predicts the incidence and case fatality of coronary heart disease (CHD), and whether effects vary across sociodemographic groups.
Methods
Prospective follow-up study of all Swedish women and men, aged 35 to 74 (1.9 million women, 1.8 million men). Women and men, without a history of CHD, were assessed on December 31, 1995, and followed from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2000, for first fatal or nonfatal CHD event (130,024 cases); data were analyzed in 2006. Neighborhood-level deprivation (index of education, income, unemployment, welfare assistance) was categorized as low, moderate, and high deprivation.
Results
Age-standardized CHD incidence was 1.9 times higher for women and 1.5 times higher for men in high- versus low-deprivation neighborhoods; 1-year case fatality from CHD was 1.6 times higher for women and 1.7 times higher for men in high versus low deprivation neighborhoods. The higher incidence in more deprived neighborhoods was observed across all individual-level sociodemographic groups (age, marital status, family income, education, immigration status, mobility, and urban/rural status). In multilevel logistic regression models, neighborhood deprivation remained significantly associated with both CHD incidence and case fatality for women and men after adjusting for the seven sociodemographic factors (p values {\textless}0.01). Effects were slightly stronger for women than men in an ancillary analysis that tested for gender differences.
Conclusions
The clustering of CHD and subsequent mortality among adults in deprived neighborhoods raises important clinical and public health concerns, and calls for a reframing of health problems to include neighborhood social environments, as they may affect health.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Previous studies of neighborhood deprivation and mental disorders have yielded mixed results, possibly because they were based on different substrata of the population. We conducted a national multilevel study to determine whether neighborhood deprivation is independently associated with psychiatric medication prescription in a national population.
Methods
Nationwide outpatient and inpatient psychiatric medication data were analyzed for all Swedish adults (N = 6,998,075) after 2.5 years of follow-up. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the association between neighborhood deprivation (index of education, income, unemployment, and welfare assistance) and prescription of psychiatric medications (antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, or hypnotics/sedatives), after adjusting for broadly measured individual-level sociodemographic characteristics.
Results
For each psychiatric medication class, a monotonic trend of increasing prescription was observed by increasing level of neighborhood deprivation. The strongest associations were found for antipsychotics and anxiolytics, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.40 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.36–1.44) and 1.24 (95\% CI, 1.22–1.27), respectively, comparing the highest- to the lowest-deprivation neighborhood quintiles.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that neighborhood deprivation is associated with psychiatric medication prescription independent of individual-level sociodemographic characteristics. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which neighborhood deprivation may affect mental health and to identify the most susceptible groups in the population.},

Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed with individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level.Results:The age-standardized prostate cancer mortality rate was 1.5 times higher in men living in high-deprivation neighborhoods than in those living in the most affluent neighborhoods. Mortality rates were also associated with certain individual-level characteristics, that is, age, marital status, family income, educational attainment, immigration status, urban/rural status, mobility and comorbidity. For example, there was a strong relationship between prostate cancer mortality and being unmarried, having a low income or educational attainment, and hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the full model, the risk of prostate cancer mortality was 25\% higher in men living in the most deprived neighborhoods than in those living in the most affluent neighborhoods.Conclusions:High level of neighborhood deprivation independently predicts prostate cancer mortality.

The entire Swedish population aged 25–74 was followed from January 1, 2000 until hospitalization for VTE, death, emigration, or the end of the study period (December 31, 2008). Data were analyzed by multilevel logistic regression, with individual-level characteristics (age, marital status, family income, educational attainment, immigration status, urban/rural status, mobility, and comorbidity) at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. Neighborhood deprivation was significantly associated with VTE hospitalization rate in both men (OR = 1.09) and women (OR = 1.38). In the full model, which took account of individual-level socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidities, the odds of VTE remained significant only in women (OR = 1.12, 95 \% CI 1.06–1.20) in the most deprived neighborhoods. Neighborhood characteristics affect odds of hospitalization for VTE, particularly in women. Thus, neighborhood deprivation is a common risk factor for both arterial cardiovascular disease and VTE.

	abstract = {Objectives
To analyze whether there is an association between neighborhood deprivation and cervical cancer morbidity and mortality, beyond individual level characteristics.
Design
The entire Swedish population aged 25 to 74, a total of 1.9million women, were followed from January 1, 1990, until hospital admission due to cervical cancer during the study period, or the end of the study on December 31, 2008. Multilevel logistic regression was used in the analysis with individual level characteristics (age, marital status, family income, education, immigration status, urban/rural status, mobility, comorbidities, parities, and number of partners) at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. Neighborhood deprivation was measured at small area market statistics level by the use of an index.
Results
There was a strong association between level of neighborhood deprivation and cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. In the full model, which took account of the individual level characteristics, the risks of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality were 1.25 and 1.36, respectively, in the most deprived neighborhoods. The between neighborhood variance was over twice the standard error, indicating significant differences in cervical cancer morbidity and mortality between neighborhoods.
Conclusions
This study is the largest to date of the influences of neighborhood deprivation on cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. The results suggest that neighborhood characteristics affect cervical cancer morbidity and mortality independently of individual level sociodemographic characteristics. Both individual and neighborhood level approaches are important in health care policies.},

	abstract = {This large scale computer-assisted telephone survey was undertaken to explore the prevalence, severity, treatment and impact of chronic pain in 15 European countries and Israel. Screening interviews identified respondents aged ≥18 years with chronic pain for in-depth interviews. 19\% of 46,394 respondents willing to participate (refusal rate 46\%) had suffered pain for ≥6 months, had experienced pain in the last month and several times during the last week. Their pain intensity was ≥5 on a 10-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (1 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) during last episode of pain. In-depth interviews with 4839 respondents with chronic pain (about 300 per country) showed: 66\% had moderate pain (NRS = 5–7), 34\% had severe pain (NRS = 8–10), 46\% had constant pain, 54\% had intermittent pain. 59\% had suffered with pain for two to 15 years, 21\% had been diagnosed with depression because of their pain, 61\% were less able or unable to work outside the home, 19\% had lost their job and 13\% had changed jobs because of their pain. 60\% visited their doctor about their pain 2–9 times in the last six months. Only 2\% were currently treated by a pain management specialist. One-third of the chronic pain sufferers were currently not being treated. Two-thirds used non-medication treatments, e.g,. massage (30\%), physical therapy (21\%), acupuncture (13\%). Almost half were taking non-prescription analgesics; ‘over the counter’ (OTC) NSAIDs (55\%), paracetamol (43\%), weak opioids (13\%). Two-thirds were taking prescription medicines: NSAIDs (44\%), weak opioids (23\%), paracetamol (18\%), COX-2 inhibitors (1-36\%), and strong opioids (5\%). Forty percent had inadequate management of their pain. Interesting differences between countries were observed, possibly reflecting differences in cultural background and local traditions in managing chronic pain. Conclusions: Chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity occurs in 19\% of adult Europeans, seriously affecting the quality of their social and working lives. Very few were managed by pain specialists and nearly half received inadequate pain management. Although differences were observed between the 16 countries, we have documented that chronic pain is a major health care problem in Europe that needs to be taken more seriously.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic pain is recognised as an important problem in the community but our understanding of the epidemiology of chronic pain remains limited. We undertook a study designed to quantify and describe the prevalence and distribution of chronic pain in the community.
Methods
A random sample of 5036 patients, aged 25 and over, was drawn from 29 general practices in the Grampian region of the UK and surveyed by a postal self-completion questionnaire. The questionnaire included case-screening questions, a question on the cause of the pain, the chronic pain grade questionnaire, the level of expressed needs questionnaire, and sociodemographic questions.
Findings
3605 questionnaires were returned completed. 1817 (50·4\%) of patients self reported chronic pain, equivalent to 46·5\% of the general population. 576 reported back pain and 570 reported arthritis; these were the most common complaints and accounted for a third of all complaints. Backward stepwise logistic-regression modelling identified age, sex, housing tenure, and employment status as significant predictors of the presence of chronic pain in the community. 703 (48·7\%) individuals with chronic pain had the least severe grade of pain, and 228 (15·8\%) the most severe grade. Of those who reported chronic pain, 312 (17·2\%) reported no expressed need, and 509 (28·0\%) reported the highest expressed need.
Interpretation
Chronic pain is a major problem in the community and certain groups within the population are more likely to have chronic pain. A detailed understanding of the epidemiology of chronic pain is essential for efficient management of chronic pain in primary care.},
