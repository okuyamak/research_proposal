	\frametitle{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The prevalence of \textbf{anxiety has been increasing for 25 years} in Sweden (\textit{Calling, 2017}).
		\item \textbf{Especially among young females (16-23 years),} 1/3 experienced anxiety in 2005, and it has increased dramatically.
		\item Anxiety is a predictor of severe psychiatric disorders (\textit{Weitoft, 2005}).
		\item Several factors were found to be associated with the prevalence of anxiety:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Urbanization
				\item Leisure time physical activity
				\item Smoking
				\item Marital status
				\item Neighborhood deprivation, social network, employnment, immigration status (\textit{Lofors, 2006})
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item However, "the reasons of increased self-reported anxiety" are unknown
		\item For example, the prevalence of leisure time PA has been increasing for 25 years (\textit{Leijon, 2015}), in parallel with the increase of the prevalence of anxiety.
		\item Potential factors:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Increased unemployment rate
				\item Incraesed awareness of mental health and decreased stigma
				\item \textbf{Urbanization}
				\item \textbf{Social interactions}
				\item \textbf{Internet use}
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{block}{Objective}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item To investigate \textbf{how direct (physical) and indirect (virtual) social interactions affect on anxiety by different neighborhood settings}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

\section{Hypothesis}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Hypothesis}
%%% left column	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Direct social interactions affect on self-reported anxiety \textbf{positively, but the effects differ by neighborhood settings}.
			\item Internet-use for social interactions affect on self-reported anxiety \textbf{positively among those in non-urban areas, but negatively among those in urban areas}.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{block}{Significance}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Regulation or utilization of internet can be considered as effective interventions for mental health in different geographical settings}
			\end{itemize}
